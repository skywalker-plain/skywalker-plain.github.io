<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction: </h3>



<p>As deep learning models continue to grow in complexity, the challenge of working with limited GPU RAM becomes increasingly prominent. Out-of-memory (OOM) errors can hinder the training process and limit the potential of your models. In this article, we explore a range of advanced strategies that go beyond the basics to prevent OOM errors and ensure efficient training within constrained GPU memory. We will discuss techniques like gradient accumulation, quantization, lit-GPT, automatic mixed-precision training, low-precision floats, efficient model initialization, choosing leaner optimizers, and parameter offloading.</p>



<div class="wp-block-ideabox-toc ib-block-toc" data-anchors='h2,h3,h4,h5,h6' data-collapsable='true' ><div class="ib-toc-container ib-toc-list-style-numbers ib-toc-hierarchical ib-toc-expanded"><div class="ib-toc-header"><div class="ib-toc-header-title">Table of Contents</div><div class="ib-toc-header-right"><span class="ib-toc-icon-collapse"><span class="dashicon dashicons dashicons-minus"></span></span><span class="ib-toc-icon-expand"><span class="dashicon dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span></div></div><div class="ib-toc-separator" style="height:2px"></div><div class="ib-toc-body"><ol class="ib-toc-anchors"></ol></div></div></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gradient Accumulation</strong></h3>



<p>Gradient accumulation involves accumulating gradients over multiple mini-batches before performing a parameter update. This technique effectively reduces memory consumption during the backward pass since gradients from different mini-batches are stored and computed sequentially. By trading off computation time for memory, gradient accumulation can help prevent OOM errors. However, it&#8217;s important to adjust the learning rate accordingly, as fewer updates are being performed.Imagine you&#8217;re trying to paint a wall, but you can only hold a small amount of paint in your brush. Instead of painting the entire wall in one go, you paint a small section, then go back and paint another section, and so on. This way, you use up less paint at once, even though it takes a bit longer to finish the entire wall. Similarly, in training a model, gradient accumulation spreads out the updates so that the computer doesn&#8217;t get overwhelmed with too much information all at once.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quantization</h3>



<p>Quantization is a method that reduces the precision of the weights and activations of a model, thereby saving memory. Floating-point numbers typically require more memory than fixed-point representations. Techniques like mixed-precision training utilize lower precision data types (such as float16) for activations and gradients while keeping higher precision for certain weights (like embedding layers). This helps in conserving GPU memory without significantly compromising model performance.Think of a recipe that calls for precise measurements of ingredients, like sugar. If you use a digital scale with many decimal places, you get very precise measurements, but sometimes you only need a rough estimate. So, you decide to use a simpler scale that rounds to the nearest gram. This is like quantization, where we simplify the numbers we use in the model to save memory, just like we&#8217;re using a simpler scale to measure ingredients.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LoRA)</h3>



<p>Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling is a technique designed to mitigate OOM errors during training. It involves adaptively adjusting the learning rates of individual layers based on their memory requirements. This allows memory-intensive layers to have smaller learning rates, preventing excessive memory usage. LoRA ensures that layers receive an appropriate amount of updates without causing memory overflow.Imagine you&#8217;re baking a layered cake, and each layer needs just the right amount of baking time to be perfectly moist. Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LoRA) is like adjusting the oven temperature differently for each cake layer so that they all bake evenly. In a deep learning model, each layer learns at its own pace, and LoRA ensures that learning rates are customized, preventing some layers from overpowering others. This way, the model trains smoothly and produces accurate results, just like your cake layers come out delicious and balanced.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;lit-GPT.&#8221; Lit-GPT (Lightweight Generative Pre-trained Transformer) </h3>



<p>is specifically designed to offer a balance between model size and performance. These models are often pre-trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to capture essential patterns while maintaining a smaller number of parameters compared to their larger counterparts. Lit-GPT models are particularly advantageous when dealing with constrained GPU resources. Their reduced parameter count directly translates to lower memory consumption during training, making them less likely to encounter OOM errors. Despite their smaller size, they still exhibit impressive language generation capabilities, making them a valuable asset for various natural language processing tasks.By opting for lit-GPT models, you can effectively sidestep the challenges associated with limited GPU RAM. These models allow you to work with intricate language patterns and generate high-quality text while operating within the confines of your available memory resources. Imagine you have two storybooksâ€”one is a giant encyclopedia, and the other is a smaller book that still tells you many interesting stories. The smaller book is like a lightweight model; it has fewer pages (parameters) but still captures the essence of the stories (language patterns). You can read and enjoy stories from the smaller book without feeling overwhelmed, just like you can use a lightweight model on your computer without running out of memory.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Automatic Mixed-Precision Training</h3>



<p>Automatic mixed-precision training combines both high and low-precision operations within a single training iteration. This technique optimizes memory usage by using lower precision for less critical operations, reducing memory footprint and accelerating training without compromising on model quality. Picture yourself working on a jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces have intricate details that you need to fit together precisely, while others are larger and less detailed. Instead of using a single-size tool for all the pieces, you switch between a fine-tipped tool for the detailed parts and a broader tool for the bigger parts. Similarly, in mixed-precision training, we use different &#8220;tools&#8221; (number representations) for different parts of the model to make the training process faster and more memory-efficient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Low-Precision Floats</h3>



<p>Using low-precision floating-point representations, such as float16, for training and inference significantly reduces memory requirements. While some precision may be lost, the impact on model performance can be minimal, and the benefits in terms of memory conservation are substantial. Imagine you have a balance scale that measures weight. If you use a scale that measures weight very accurately, you&#8217;ll see very small changes even if you add just a tiny bit of weight. Now, think of using a scale that rounds to the nearest kilogram. You might not catch tiny changes, but it&#8217;s much faster and easier to use. Similarly, low-precision floats round numbers to make them simpler, which saves memory and speeds up calculations in the model.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Efficient Model Initialization</h3>



<p>Proper model initialization can influence convergence and memory efficiency. Techniques like &#8220;Xavier&#8221; initialization set initial weights in a way that promotes faster convergence, potentially requiring fewer training iterations and less memory consumption. Think of a car engine. When it&#8217;s cold, it takes a little while to start running smoothly. If you warm up the engine a bit before driving, it&#8217;s more efficient and uses less fuel. Similarly, in training a model, efficient initialization sets up the model in a way that helps it start learning more effectively and with less memory &#8220;wasted&#8221; on unnecessary steps.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leaner Optimizers</h3>



<p>Choosing leaner optimization algorithms, such as AdamW or RMSprop, instead of heavier optimizers like vanilla Adam, can lead to reduced memory consumption. These algorithms often have memory-efficient implementations and provide good convergence properties. Consider two ways of carrying groceries: a backpack and a trolley. If you have fewer groceries, using a backpack is more efficient because it&#8217;s easier to carry around. Similarly, leaner optimizers are like using a backpack for your modelâ€”they&#8217;re lighter and more efficient, allowing the training process to run smoothly without needing too much &#8220;energy&#8221; (memory) to move forward.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Parameter Offloading</h3>



<p>Offloading certain parameters to the CPU during training can alleviate memory pressure on the GPU. By temporarily storing infrequently used parameters on the CPU, you free up GPU memory for more critical computations. Imagine you&#8217;re baking cookies, and you have a limited counter space. Some ingredients are used frequently, so you keep them on the counter. But other ingredients that you use less often, like a special spice, you keep in a nearby cupboard and only take them out when needed. Offloading parameters is like temporarily moving some ingredients off the counter to the cupboard, freeing up space for the important stuff and preventing clutter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Navigating the challenges of limited GPU RAM while training deep learning models requires a combination of strategies tailored to your specific needs. Employing techniques like gradient accumulation, quantization, lit-GPT, automatic mixed-precision training, low-precision floats, efficient model initialization, choosing leaner optimizers, and parameter offloading can collectively empower you to achieve efficient training and prevent out-of-memory errors. Experimentation and careful implementation of these advanced strategies will allow you to harness the full potential of your models within the confines of constrained GPU memory.</p>

<p>a renowned expert in the field of diabetes research, recently delivered an insightful talk at a conference, shedding light on the latest advancements in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351199#:~:text=Treatment%20also%20includes%20diet%20and,height%20to%20estimate%20body%20fat.">Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) management.</a> The conference covered various aspects, including nutritional therapy, long-term weight maintenance, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3712370/">GLP-1 analogues</a>, and combination therapy. This article aims to distill the key takeaways from his talk, focusing on essential topics such as personalized treatment approaches, the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists, <a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/sglt2-inhibitors#:~:text=SGLT2%20inhibitors%2C%20which%20are%20also,leaves%20through%20in%20your%20urine.">SGLT2 inhibitors</a>, and the Defranzo algorithm for optimal glycemic control.I will share some key takeaways from the conference that can help individuals better understand and manage T2D effectively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nutritional Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes</h3>



<p>One of the central themes discussed at the conference was the importance of nutritional therapy in managing T2D. The focus was on personalized approaches tailored to each individual&#8217;s needs. Studies have shown that an individualized, reduced caloric intake (-500 to -700 cal/day) can be effective as long as the diet is maintained. The Mediterranean diet was highlighted as a beneficial option, involving reduced simple sugars, increased fiber/plant sterols, and mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA) were also noted to have proven benefits. Additionally, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456">the DASH diet</a>, which is rich in potassium and low in sodium, and vegetarian or time-restricted diets were shown to be effective in managing T2D.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How AI can assist?</h4>



<p>AI can assist in developing personalized and effective caloric intake plans for managing T2D.For example, when designing a Mediterranean diet plan, AI can take into account factors like reduced simple sugars, increased fiber/plant sterols, and mono- and polyunsaturated fats. AI can also identify appropriate sources of long-chain <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22332096/">omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA)</a>, aligning with the proven benefits mentioned in the conference.AI can monitor food intake, analyze nutrient intake, and provide real-time feedback to the user. For example, if someone exceeds their recommended daily caloric intake, the AI chatbot can provide gentle reminders and suggestions for healthier food choices. AI can assist in creating meal plans and suggesting healthy recipes that align with specific dietary requirements, such as the DASH diet or vegetarian options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Long-Term Maintenance of Weight Loss</h3>



<p>Maintaining weight loss over the long term is a significant challenge for individuals with T2D. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764193/">A meta-analysis of 29 studies</a> and 4,146 participants revealed that after initial weight loss of 10.5 kg, an average of 7 kg was regained after four years, with a discouraging 71% weight regain after 4.5 years. These findings emphasize the need for sustainable lifestyle changes and continuous support to prevent weight regain and improve overall health outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GLP-1 Analogs &#8211; A Promising Treatment Option:</h3>



<p> GLP-1 analogues, a class of medications, emerged as a promising treatment option for T2D. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551568/">Drugs like Exenatide BID, Lixisenatide, Liraglutide, Exenatide QW, Albiglutide QW, Dulaglutide QW, Semaglutide QW</a>, and oral Semaglutide have shown efficacy in improving glycemic control and promoting weight loss. Semaglutide &#8211; oral, and Tirzepatide are among the newer formulations, offering alternatives for patients who may prefer non-injectable options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Combination Therapy for Rapid and Effective Glycemic Control</h3>



<p>T2D is a progressive disease, and it becomes challenging to maintain glycemic targets with monotherapy over time. Traditionally, stepwise addition of medications to metformin has been recommended. However, recent data supports the use of initial combination therapy for achieving glycemic goals more rapidly and maintaining longer-lasting glycemic effects. This approach may offer better control of blood sugar levels, potentially reducing the risk of diabetes-related complications.</p>



<p>For patients using GLP-1 analogs or combination therapy, AI chatbots can serve as reliable medication reminders, helping patients adhere to their prescribed regimens. By analyzing medical histories, glycemic responses, and other health parameters, the chatbot can offer insights into optimal drug combinations, considering factors like GLP-1 analogs, SGLT2 inhibitors, or other medications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Regular Exercise &#8211; A Key to Diabetes Management:</h3>



<p>Imagine your body as a car that needs to run smoothly. Regular exercise is like fueling your car with the right gas. Just as fuel powers your car&#8217;s engine, exercise powers your body, especially when dealing with diabetes. By engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day, you give your body the energy it needs to improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. It&#8217;s like a powerful engine tune-up that helps your body work more efficiently and keeps your blood sugar in check.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time-Restricted Eating for Glycemic Control</h3>



<p>Think of your body&#8217;s digestion system as a factory that works best during specific hours. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016882272300044X#:~:text=Time%2Drestricted%20eating%20(TRE)%2C%20where%20energy%20is%20consumed,intake%20to%20improve%20metabolic%20health.">Time-restricted eating </a>is like setting the factory&#8217;s operating hours, allowing it to function more smoothly and efficiently. By limiting the time window for eating, your body has more time to process food, which can enhance insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss. It&#8217;s like optimizing the factory&#8217;s production schedule, leading to better management of blood sugar levels and overall health.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How AI can help? </h4>



<p>Think of AI as a helpful timekeeper for your meals. It&#8217;s like having a smart clock that tells you the best hours to eat, making sure you get the most out of your food. AI can remind you when it&#8217;s time to eat and when it&#8217;s time to pause, giving your body a break to process food efficiently. Just like how a good schedule helps you stay organized, AI can assist in keeping your eating habits on track, potentially supporting better insulin sensitivity and weight management.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Mediterranean Diet &#8211; A Heart-Healthy Choice</h3>

<p>Metaphor: Consider your body as a garden that needs the right nutrients to flourish. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">The Mediterranean diet</a> is like planting a variety of colorful and nutritious fruits, vegetables, and grains in your garden. Just as diverse plants enrich the soil and attract beneficial insects, the Mediterranean diet enriches your body with essential nutrients and lowers cardiovascular risks. It&#8217;s like cultivating a heart-healthy garden that supports better glycemic control and overall well-being.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How AI can help? </h4>



<p>AI can be your personal nutritionist, customizing a tasty menu that suits your tastes and keeps your heart happy. It&#8217;s like having a digital chef that suggests delicious recipes packed with nutritious ingredients. AI knows which foods are good for you, like colorful fruits, veggies, and healthy fats, and can create a meal plan that supports your diabetes management goals. Like a culinary genius, AI offers ideas that can help you enjoy food while improving glycemic control and reducing heart risks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medication Options for T2D</h3>



<p>Treating diabetes is like assembling a superhero team to protect your body. Each medication option is like a superhero with unique powers to battle high blood sugar levels. Metformin is like a protector, reducing sugar production in the liver. Pioglitazone is like an enhancer, making your body&#8217;s insulin work better. Insulin is like a lifesaver, stepping in when other superheroes need extra help. <a href="https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-023-01798-4#:~:text=Both%20glucagon%2Dlike%20peptide%2D1,risk%20%5B3%2C%204%5D.">GLP-1 RA and SGLT2 inhibitors</a> are like double agents, helping your body release insulin and remove excess sugar, all while promoting weight loss. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542331/">DPP-IV inhibitors </a>are like guards, preventing the destruction of helpful hormones. Together, these superheroes work as a team to keep your blood sugar in check and protect your health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Glucose Monitoring and the Defranzo Algorithm</h3>



<p>Imagine managing diabetes as navigating a ship through rough waters. Regular glucose monitoring is like having a reliable compass, guiding you through the storm. By checking your blood sugar levels regularly, you get crucial information about how your body is doing. The Defranzo algorithm is like a skilled captain, making informed decisions based on the compass readings. Just as the captain adjusts the ship&#8217;s course to sail smoothly, the Defranzo algorithm helps your healthcare team make personalized treatment adjustments to achieve the best control of your blood sugar levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The AACE Diabetes Conclave provided valuable insights into managing Type 2 Diabetes, highlighting the significance of personalized nutritional therapy, long-term weight maintenance, GLP-1 analogues, and combination therapy. With AI&#8217;s potential assistance, these approaches can be further optimized, leading to better glycemic control and improved overall health outcomes for individuals with T2D.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AI-powered demand forecasting for accurate inventory planning and proactive decision-making in<br>logistics.</h3>



<p>Consider this: it takes an average of 6 months to manufacture a tire (tire design, raw material sourcing, mixing and extrusion, tire building, curing, quality assurance, and packaging) and during this time, the market can undergo significant changes. Without precise forecasting, businesses risk being unprepared for fluctuations in demand, leading to excess inventory or stock-outs.</p>



<p>I recently attended an event <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/cii-il">CII IL &#8216;Solution de Technology, Automation &amp; Robotics</a>&#8216; on 21 July 2023, Hotel The Lalit, New Delhi. Session Chairman <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rishidiwan103">Mr Rishi Diwan</a> did a great job of picking great panelists. In a thought-provoking panel discussion, top industry leaders from the logistics sector gathered to shed light on the game-changing impact of automation. The distinguished panelists included <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/anil-syal-2b410b90">Mr. Anil Syal</a>, President of Safexpress Private Limited; <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/devang-mankodi-76bb979">Mr. Devang Mankodi</a>, Vice President &#8211; Shared Service at DP World; <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/manish-gupta-543a1212">Mr. Manish Kumar Gupta</a>, Head &#8211; Spare Parts Logistics, Honda Cars India Ltd; <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rajeshgupta21">Mr. Rajesh Gupta</a>, Head-Supply Chain Management, JK Tyre &amp; Industries Limited; and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/vikas-kalra-50509144">Mr. Vikas Kalra, </a>Head-Supply Chain Management, Hindware Home Innovation Limited.</p>



<p>The logistics industry is undergoing a profound transformation with the advent of automation. This revolutionary technology is redefining operations, fostering efficiency, and propelling growth. Embracing automation empowers logistics providers to streamline processes, boost productivity, and expand their business horizons. By harnessing the full potential of automation, these companies can attain operational excellence, unearth inventive solutions, and maintain a competitive edge in a constantly evolving market.</p>



<div class="wp-block-ideabox-toc ib-block-toc" data-anchors='h2,h3,h4,h5,h6' data-collapsable='true' ><div class="ib-toc-container ib-toc-list-style-numbers ib-toc-hierarchical ib-toc-expanded"><div class="ib-toc-header"><div class="ib-toc-header-title">Table of Contents</div><div class="ib-toc-header-right"><span class="ib-toc-icon-collapse"><span class="dashicon dashicons dashicons-minus"></span></span><span class="ib-toc-icon-expand"><span class="dashicon dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span></div></div><div class="ib-toc-separator" style="height:2px"></div><div class="ib-toc-body"><ol class="ib-toc-anchors"></ol></div></div></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Demand planning and forecasting is the weakest link in the chain</h4>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game">The bear game</a> is a popular logistics training exercise where participants simulate managing the movement of goods in a supply chain. It demonstrates the importance of demand forecasting in logistics by highlighting how accurate predictions help participants anticipate and respond to fluctuations in demand, allowing them to optimize inventory levels and ensure efficient supply chain management in a dynamic environment.Each participant takes on the role of a different supply chain stakeholder, such as a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer. As the game progresses, participants face challenges like transportation delays, stockouts, or sudden changes in demand.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Traditional forecasting vs AI-powered forecasting</h4>



<p>While traditional statistical demand forecasting relies on historical data spanning 24 to 26 months, its limited scope and inability to capture real-time factors hinder its accuracy (60/75%). In contrast, AI-powered demand forecasting, leveraging real-time data and machine learning algorithms, can surpass traditional methods. By incorporating variables like GDP growth, market dynamics, weather conditions, and more, AI-driven models can achieve 95 to 98% accuracy, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions and stay agile in the face of market changes.</p>



<p>Similar to how Google Maps dynamically updates its estimated arrival time based on real-time traffic conditions, AI-powered demand forecasting should continuously adapt to changing market dynamics.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How generative AI can make forecasting for logistics more accurate</h4>



<p>Generative AI, specifically Language Models like Large Language Models (LLMs), holds great promise in revolutionizing demand forecasting. LLMs can analyze vast amounts of textual data from diverse sources, such as customer reviews, social media, news articles, and industry reports. By comprehensively understanding customer sentiments, market trends, and emerging events, LLMs provide valuable insights for demand forecasting models. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario Analysis made possible by generative AI</h4>



<p>LLMs can generate hypothetical scenarios based on given conditions, helping businesses anticipate various demand outcomes. This <a href="https://www.planettogether.com/blog/the-importance-of-what-if-scenarios-in-production-planning">scenario analysis allows demand planners to explore &#8220;what-if&#8221; situations </a>and strategize effectively for different scenarios.</p>



<p>This is how it could work:</p>



<p class="has-neve-link-hover-color-color has-text-color">AI Assistant: (Responding) Sure, let&#8217;s get started. Please upload the historical sales data and any other relevant market information.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">With a license that authorizes commercial use! BUT &#8230;.</h4>



<p>Its better than falcon 7b on most benchmarks, and its 2x better than falcon on QuACÂ (Question Answering in Context), and MMLUÂ (Massive Multitask Language Understanding). Way to goÂ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAADFk0BbiOeu2Wrer11SaPH_5m1GM8pG6Q">Yann LeCun</a>, can&#8217;t wait to instruct fine tune this with QLORA. But there is a lot of concerns about the licenses, is it really open for commercial use?</p>



<p>So I analyzedÂ  <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE">Llama 2&#8217;s Community License Agreement</a>, and here are the results:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fine tuning:</h3>



<p>The Llama 2 Community License Agreement does not explicitly mention fine-tuning. <a href="https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapter">Fine-tuning</a> is a common practice in the field of natural language processing (NLP) where a pre-trained language model, like Llama 2, is further trained on a specific dataset or task to make it more specialized and accurate for that particular use case.</p>



<p>Since the agreement grants a license to use, reproduce, distribute, and create derivative works of the Llama Materials, it is reasonable to assume that fine-tuning is allowed as long as it falls within the scope of the granted license. In other words, if you fine-tune Llama 2 and create a derivative model for a specific task or dataset, you can use and distribute that fine-tuned model under the terms of the Llama 2 Community License Agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Attribution Notice:</h3>



<p>When distributing the Llama Materials or derivative works, you must include an attribution notice stating that Llama 2 is licensed under the LLAMA 2 Community License by Meta Platforms, Inc. </p>



<p>Example: Company G uses Llama 2 to develop an AI-powered chat application. When releasing the application, they include the required <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/attribution-notices">attribution notice</a> within the application&#8217;s documentation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ownership of Derivative Works</h3>



<p>If you create derivative works and modifications of the Llama Materials, you will be the owner of those works.</p>



<p>Example: Individual F develops a new AI algorithm using Llama 2 as a foundation and can claim ownership of their new algorithm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">License to Use and Modify</h3>



<p>The Agreement grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, and royalty-free limited license to use, reproduce, distribute, copy, create derivative works of, and modify the Llama Materials. </p>



<p>Example: Company E can create an AI-powered language translation service using Llama 2 and offer it to their customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h3>



<p>Your use of Llama Materials must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations, including trade compliance laws and regulations.</p>



<p>Example: Company D, based in the United States, must ensure that their use of Llama 2 complies with export control laws and regulations when providing their AI services to clients in other countries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prohibited Improving Other Models</h3>



<p>You are not allowed to use the Llama Materials or any results obtained from them to improve any other large language model that is not Llama 2 or its derivatives. </p>



<p>Example: Company C cannot use the knowledge gained from Llama 2 to enhance the capabilities of their own proprietary language model or any other language model they use in their products.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Monthly Active Users Limit: </h3>



<p>If your product or service, along with its affiliates, reaches over 700 million monthly active users, you must request a separate license from Meta, and until you receive such license, you cannot exercise the rights granted under the Agreement. </p>



<p>Example: Social media platform X uses Llama 2 for their AI-powered content moderation system. Once the number of their monthly active users crosses 700 million, <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/4740325989340856">they must seek a separate license from Meta</a> to continue using Llama 2 in their system. This one I find less of a restriction for startup companies and most medium size use cases.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Redistribution to Third Parties: </h3>



<p>If you distribute or make the Llama Materials or any derivative works thereof available to a third party, you must provide a copy of the License Agreement to them. This means you cannot simply give the Llama Materials to others without informing them of the terms and conditions. </p>



<p>Example: Company A creates an AI-powered chatbot using Llama 2 and wants to sell it to Company B for use on their website. Before doing so, Company A must provide a copy of the License Agreement to Company B</p>



<p>Overall, its good news for startups. Of course <a href="./../../../managing-model-training-costs/index.html">fine tuning</a> this beast is another challenge. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/the-ai-brick-wall-a-practical-limit">research arm of SemiAnalysis</a> has done surveys of many startups and enterprises and arrived at ~$1.5 per SXM A100 GPU per hour as a baseline cost for large clusters of 256 GPUs with NVLink and 1.6T networking. Some companies have better deals with AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud, <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/">CoreWeave</a>, etc., but this is a baseline. For example, the list price at Azure is only $1.36 per hour, but signing up for the 2020 released A100 for three years is not something most want to do. On-premises will also be cheaper over multiple years if utilization rates are high, but that is very difficult for most enterprises and startups to commit to/achieve.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Affordable AI Training: MosaicML Claims GPT-3 Level Models at a Fraction of the Cost</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mosaicml.com/">MosaicML</a>, a company in the AI field, claims they can train models that are as good as GPT-3 (which is a super impressive model) for less than $500,000! They can even train smaller models for about $2,500,000. That sounds like a lot, but in the AI world, it&#8217;s actually quite affordable.</p>



<p>According to some research, the baseline cost for a big cluster of 256 GPUs (that&#8217;s a lot!) with all the fancy networking stuff is around $1.5 per GPU per hour.</p>



<p>You know, training AI models is not just about having a powerful machine and pressing a button. There are many other things to consider that can be quite costly &#8211; the people involved, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-mlops-tools">ML Ops tools</a> (which help manage the whole process), gathering and preparing the data, dealing with failures and restoring the process, and even handling situations where we want the model to learn from just a few examples. All of these components can add up to be quite expensive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Power of Smaller Models: Chinchilla Scaling Observations Redefine Cost-Effective AI Training</h3>



<p>Nowadays, many people are following something called the <a href="https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast/the-chinchilla-scaling-laws">Chinchilla scaling observations</a>. These observations tell us that it&#8217;s more cost-effective to train smaller models with more data rather than training the biggest and most advanced models. While there are some criticisms of these observations, the overall idea is that we can get good results without spending too much money by focusing on smaller models with lots of data.</p>



<p>Imagine we have a really big model with lots and lots of parameters. These parameters help the model learn and make smart decisions. Right now, we can train a model with about 1 trillion parameters, and it would cost around $300 million to do so. That&#8217;s a huge amount of money!</p>



<p>To train such a big model, we would need a lot of powerful machines called A100s. If we had 100,000 of these machines working together, it would take about three months to finish training the model. This is something that big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and others can afford because they have lots of money to spend on these machines.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scaling Limits: The Challenges of Training Mega-Models with Trillions of Parameters</h3>



<p>But what if we wanted to go even bigger? Let&#8217;s say we wanted to train a model with 10 trillion parameters. <a href="https://mpost.io/ai-model-training-costs-are-expected-to-rise-from-100-million-to-500-million-by-2030/">The training costs would go up to around $30 billion</a>! That&#8217;s an enormous amount of money, even for the big tech companies. We would need one million of those A100 machines working together, and it would take more than two years to complete the training. It&#8217;s a really long time!</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, the amount of power needed for all those machines and the networking required would be like having a nuclear reactor generating electricity. It&#8217;s not something we can easily handle with our current technology.</p>



<p>So, training models with trillions and trillions of parameters is not practical right now. It would cost too much money and take too long. Plus, there are limitations in terms of how accurate these models can be and how well they can be compressed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Affordable Alternatives: Training AI Models on a Budget</h3>



<p>For organizations that don&#8217;t have the financial resources to train large-scale AI models with billions or trillions of parameters, there are still options available. Here are a few recommendations:</p>



<ol>
<li>Start small: Instead of aiming for the largest and most complex models, begin with smaller models that have fewer parameters. While they may not have the same level of performance as the massive models, they can still provide useful insights and results.</li>



<li>Use pre-trained models: Many pre-trained models are available that have been trained by big tech companies or research institutions. These models have already undergone extensive training and can be fine-tuned or adapted to suit specific tasks or domains. By using pre-trained models, organizations can save on the cost of training from scratch.</li>



<li>Focus on data quality and preprocessing: Data plays a crucial role in training AI models. Ensuring high-quality data and investing in data preprocessing techniques can have a significant impact on model performance. By optimizing data collection, cleaning, and labeling processes, organizations can improve their models&#8217; accuracy and effectiveness.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing Large Language Models: Unleashing Task-Specific Efficiency with Parameter Selection and Pruning</h3>



<p>To determine which parameters of a large language model are most suitable for your specific task, you can follow a process called &#8220;parameter selection&#8221; or &#8220;parameter pruning.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@shaistha24/how-to-choose-a-pre-trained-model-afd3dbd75b45">Pretrained Model Selection</a>: Start by selecting a large pretrained language model that aligns with your task. Models like GPT-3 or BERT are commonly used as a starting point due to their extensive pretraining on diverse datasets.</li>



<li>Task-Specific Dataset: Gather a dataset that is relevant to your specific task. This dataset should consist of labeled examples that represent the input-output pairs you want the model to learn.</li>



<li>Parameter Importance Calculation: Apply a method to calculate the importance or relevance of each parameter based on the extracted activations. One popular technique is &#8220;<a href="https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2020/pdf/PML4DC2020_17.pdf">magnitude-based pruning</a>&#8221; which ranks parameters based on their absolute values.</li>



<li>Parameter Pruning: Set a threshold value to determine which parameters to keep and which ones to discard. Parameters with values below the threshold are considered less important and can be pruned (removed) from the model.</li>



<li>Fine-tuning: Once you have pruned the unnecessary parameters, you can fine-tune the remaining parameters using your task-specific dataset. During fine-tuning, only the remaining parameters are updated, while the pruned parameters stay fixed.</li>



<li>Evaluation and Iteration: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on your task-specific validation or test dataset. If the results are satisfactory, you can proceed with deploying the model. Otherwise, you may need to iterate the process by adjusting the pruning threshold or exploring different model architectures or hyperparameters.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>



<p>By starting with smaller models, leveraging pre-trained models, and focusing on data quality and preprocessing, organizations can make significant progress. In the end, it&#8217;s not always about having the biggest and most complex model, but rather finding the right balance between model size, data quality, and computational resources.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Unveiling the Secret Sauce: How Sparse Model Architecture is Revolutionizing AI Inference!</h3>



<p>The Scaling Challenge: Why Size Isn&#8217;t Everything</p>



<p>Have you heard about these dense transformer model architectures that companies like OpenAI, Google, Meta, TII, <a href="https://www.research-live.com/article/news/databricks-to-acquire-mosaicml/id/5113812">MosaicML</a>, and a bunch of others are using? They&#8217;re all the rage in the AI world. But let me tell ya, they&#8217;re not perfect when it comes to scaling this stuff up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Inference: The Real Battle in AI Scaling</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35288063">real challenge</a> with scaling AI isn&#8217;t just about making these models bigger and beefier. Nah, the real brick wall hits when it comes to inference. That&#8217;s the process of generating predictions or outputs from these massive models. And let me tell ya, it&#8217;s a computational nightmare.</p>



<p>Think about it like this: as these models get larger, the amount of computing power needed for each inference task skyrockets. It&#8217;s like trying to power a rocket ship with a lawnmower engine. Just ain&#8217;t gonna cut it, my friends.</p>



<p>So, what&#8217;s the solution? Well, the key is to<a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/OM020291/Decoupling-AI-training-and-inference-will-change-the-future-of-AI-silicon"> decouple the training compute from the inference compute</a>. We wanna separate the resources used for training these models from the ones needed to generate predictions. That way, we can use our computational firepower more efficiently. It&#8217;s all about optimizing the process, baby!</p>



<p>Have you ever wondered how computers can think and make smart decisions, like answering questions or recognizing pictures? Well, one way they do it is by using big models with lots of special parts called parameters.</p>



<p>Now, when these models get really big, they can become a bit too slow and need a lot of power to work properly. It&#8217;s like trying to run a marathon with a heavy backpack on. Not very efficient, right?</p>



<p>So, to make things faster and more efficient, scientists came up with something called &#8220;<a href="https://goodboychan.github.io/machine_learning/2020/09/07/01-Overview-of-Sparse-Modeling.html#:~:text=The%20definition%20of%20sparse%20is,of%20non%2Dzero%20valued%20elements.">sparse models.</a>&#8221; These models are like superheroes that know how to save energy and work smartly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s how it works</h3>



<p>Imagine you have a big group of superheroes, </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-824" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>but not all of them need to do something for every task. Some superheroes are really good at solving math problems, while others are great at recognizing animals. So, instead of using all the superheroes all the time, we only use the ones that are the best fit for the job.</p>



<p>In the same way, sparse models only activate or use the special parts (parameters) that are needed for a specific task. They don&#8217;t waste energy or time on things that aren&#8217;t necessary. It&#8217;s like having a special toolbox with just the right tools for the job, instead of carrying around a heavy toolbox with all the tools in the world.</p>



<p>By using sparse models, computers can work faster, use less power, and still do a great job at thinking and making smart decisions. It&#8217;s like having a super-smart robot assistant that knows exactly what it needs to do without wasting any energy.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where the concept of sparse model architecture comes into play. In a sparse model, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-parameters-hyperparameters-and-optimization-strategies-3f0842fac0a5">not every parameter is activated during inference.</a> We don&#8217;t need &#8217;em all firing at once. Instead, we only activate the specific parameters that are relevant to the task at hand. It&#8217;s like tuning your engine to run on exactly the right fuel for the job. Efficiency, my friends!</p>



<p>So, next time you hear about sparse models, remember that they&#8217;re like superheroes that make computers faster and more efficient. Pretty cool, huh?</p>



<p>Now, I gotta say, sparse model architecture ain&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. It&#8217;s all about finding that sweet spot between inference efficiency and model performance. It&#8217;s a delicate balancing act, like walking a tightrope over a pool of hungry sharks. Okay, maybe not that dramatic, but you get my point.</p>



<p>Figuring out which parts of the sparse model to use for each task is like having a clever system that knows how to choose the right tool for the job.</p>



<p>You see, scientists and engineers train these models with lots and lots of examples. It&#8217;s like teaching the model to learn and get really good at different tasks. During this training process, the model learns which parts are good at what. It&#8217;s kind of like training a dog to fetch a ball or sit on command. The model learns which parts are best suited for different tasks, just like the dog learns different tricks.</p>



<p>Once the model has learned from all those examples, it becomes really smart at recognizing patterns. So, when it&#8217;s time to use the model for a specific task, it knows which parts to activate. It&#8217;s like the model&#8217;s brain says, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve seen this kind of task before, and I know which parts are best for it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Think of it like a superhero team. Each superhero has their own special power, right? </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-825" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-erik-mclean-7809123-930x620.jpg 930w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When a problem comes up, they know which superhero&#8217;s power is the most useful for solving it. It&#8217;s the same idea with the sparse model. It has different parts (like superheroes) that know which ones to use for different tasks.</p>



<p>By using all the knowledge it gained during training, the model can quickly figure out which parts to activate for each task it faces. It&#8217;s a bit like having a super-smart assistant who knows exactly which tools to use for different jobs.</p>



<p>So, the model becomes really good at choosing the right parts to use based on what it needs to do. It&#8217;s like having a brain that knows which buttons to press to make everything work just right.</p>



<p>By embracing sparse model architectures, these companies can overcome the challenges of scaling AI models for inference. They can separate the heavy training stuff from the nimble inference stuff, making their AI systems faster, more efficient, and ready to tackle real-world problems.</p>



<p>So, next time you hear about these dense transformer models, remember the real battle is in the realm of inference. And sparse model architecture is the secret weapon to make it all work. It&#8217;s like giving your AI system a turbo boost while sipping on a smooth whiskey.</p>

<p>GPT-4: A Closer Look at Parameters, Training, and Inference</p>



<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674905">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674905</a></p>



<p>OpenAI&#8217;s latest language model, GPT-4, has been making waves in the AI community with its impressive size and capabilities. In this article, we will delve into the details of GPT-4&#8217;s parameters, training process, and inference architecture, shedding light on the advancements made by OpenAI.</p>



<div class="wp-block-ideabox-toc ib-block-toc" data-anchors='h2,h3,h4,h5,h6' data-collapsable='true' ><div class="ib-toc-container ib-toc-list-style-numbers ib-toc-hierarchical ib-toc-expanded"><div class="ib-toc-header"><div class="ib-toc-header-title">Table of Contents</div><div class="ib-toc-header-right"><span class="ib-toc-icon-collapse"><span class="dashicon dashicons dashicons-minus"></span></span><span class="ib-toc-icon-expand"><span class="dashicon dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span></div></div><div class="ib-toc-separator" style="height:2px"></div><div class="ib-toc-body"><ol class="ib-toc-anchors"></ol></div></div></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Parameter Count: Scaling Up Significantly</h3>



<p>GPT-4 boasts a remarkable size, with more than 10 times the number of parameters compared to its predecessor, GPT-3. It is estimated to have approximately 1.8 trillion parameters across 120 layers. This increase in parameter count signifies a substantial leap forward in model size and complexity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mixture of Experts (MoE): Cost-Effective Solution</h3>



<p>To manage the costs associated with such a massive model, OpenAI implemented a mixture of experts (MoE) model in GPT-4. This approach utilizes 16 experts, each consisting of around 111 billion parameters for the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/multilayer-perceptron-explained-with-a-real-life-example-and-python-code-sentiment-analysis-cb408ee93141">MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)</a>. During each forward pass, two experts are routed, simplifying the routing process compared to more advanced algorithms discussed in the literature.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">MoE Routing: A Simpler Approach</h3>



<p>OpenAI&#8217;s routing algorithm for GPT-4 is reportedly straightforward compared to more intricate methods proposed in the research literature. The model employs approximately 55 billion shared parameters for attention, streamlining the routing process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Inference Efficiency: Optimized Parameter Usage</h3>



<p>One notable aspect of GPT-4 is its impressive inference efficiency. Each forward pass for generating a single token utilizes only around 280 billion parameters and approximately 560 <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/apeq#:~:text=for%2031.69%20years.-,TeraFLOPS,every%20second%20for%2031%2C688.77%20years">TFLOPs (tera floating-point operations per second)</a>. This stands in stark contrast to the 1.8 trillion parameters and roughly 3,700 TFLOPs required for a purely dense model per forward pass. The optimized parameter usage contributes to improved performance and reduced computational requirements.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dataset: Extensive Training Corpus</h3>



<p>GPT-4 is trained on a vast dataset comprising around 13 trillion tokens. It&#8217;s important to note that these tokens include both unique tokens and those generated during multiple epochs. The training process involves two epochs for text-based data and four epochs for code-based data. Additionally, OpenAI incorporated millions of rows of fine-tuning data from ScaleAI and internal sources to enhance the model&#8217;s performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GPT-4 32K: Fine-Tuning the Context Length</h3>



<p>During the pre-training phase, GPT-4 uses an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-context-length-hitch-gpt-models-arun-kesavan">8k context length (seqlen)</a>. However, the 32k seqlen version of GPT-4 is achieved through fine-tuning the 8k after the initial pre-training. This approach allows the model to handle longer sequences and capture more extensive context.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Batch Size: Striking a Balance</h3>



<p>OpenAI gradually ramped up the batch size over several days on the cluster, eventually reaching a batch size of 60 million. However, not every expert sees all tokens, resulting in an effective batch size of 7.5 million tokens per expert. The decision to limit the batch size ensures efficient processing and resource utilization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Parallelism Strategies: Maximizing GPU Utilization</h3>



<p>To parallelize computations across multiple A100 GPUs, OpenAI implemented 8-way tensor parallelism, as this is the maximum supported by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/nvlink/">NVLink</a>. Furthermore, they adopted 15-way pipeline parallelism to further optimize GPU utilization. It is speculated that OpenAI employed ZeRo Stage 1 and potentially utilized block-level <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism) </a>for certain aspects of the training process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training Cost: An Expensive Endeavor</h3>



<p>The training of GPT-4 came with substantial costs. OpenAI&#8217;s training FLOPS (floating-point operations per second) for GPT-4 amounted to approximately 2.15e25, utilizing around 25,000 A100 GPUs for 90 to 100 days at a utilization rate of 32% to 36% <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-MFU-Cache-Architecture_fig2_2396616">MFU (Memory Frequency Utilization)</a>. Due to numerous failures requiring restarts from checkpoints, the utilization rate remained low. Based on an estimated cloud cost of $1 per A100 hour, the training costs for this run alone would reach approximately $63 million. It is worth noting that pre-training with ~8,192 H100 GPUs could have been done in around 55 days for $21.5 million at a rate of $2 per H100 hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mixture of Expert Tradeoffs: Finding the Right Balance</h3>



<p>OpenAI made specific tradeoffs in implementing the mixture of experts model. While research has shown that using 64 to 128 experts achieves better loss compared to 16 experts, OpenAI chose a more conservative approach. The decision to stick with 16 experts was driven by the challenges associated with generalization across multiple tasks and the difficulty in achieving convergence with a larger number of experts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GPT-4 Inference Cost: Scaling with Complexity</h3>



<p>The cost of GPT-4&#8217;s inference is approximately three times higher than that of the 175B parameter GPT-3 model (Davinci). This increased cost primarily stems from the larger clusters required for GPT-4 and the lower utilization achieved during inference. An estimated cost of $0.0049 cents per 1,000 tokens is anticipated for using 128 A100 GPUs to infer GPT-4 with an 8k seqlen. In comparison, the cost reduces to $0.0021 cents per 1,000 tokens when employing 128 H100 GPUs for the same inference task. It should be noted that these estimates assume high utilization and significant batch sizes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Multi-Query Attention (MQA): Streamlining Processing</h3>



<p>Like many other models, GPT-4 utilizes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245">Multi-Query Attention (MQA)</a>. The introduction of MQA reduces the number of attention heads required, leading to a significant reduction in memory capacity for the Key-Value (KV) cache. However, due to the model&#8217;s size, the 32k seqlen GPT-4 cannot run on 40GB A100 GPUs, and the 8k seqlen version has limitations on maximum batch size.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Continuous Batching: Balancing Latency and Inference Costs</h3>



<p>OpenAI has implemented variable batch sizes and continuous batching in GPT-4&#8217;s inference process. This allows for some level of maximum latency while optimizing the overall inference costs. The combination of variable batch sizes and continuous batching ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining a balance between response times and computational expenses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vision Multi-Modal: Enhancing Capabilities</h3>



<p>GPT-4 incorporates a separate vision encoder alongside the text encoder, featuring <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/cross-attention-module#:~:text=The%20Cross%2DAttention%20module%20is,are%20projections%20to%20align%20dimensions.">cross-attention</a>. The architecture is similar to Flamingo, adding additional parameters on top of the 1.8 trillion present in GPT-4. The vision model undergoes fine-tuning with an additional ~2 trillion tokens after the initial text-only pre-training. The primary purpose of this vision capability is to enable autonomous agents to read web pages, transcribe content from images and videos, and interact with multi-modal inputs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Speculative Decoding: Enhancing Inference Efficiency</h3>



<p>There are indications that OpenAI may be employing speculative decoding during GPT-4&#8217;s inference process, although this is not confirmed. Speculative decoding involves using a smaller, faster model to generate several tokens in advance. These tokens are then fed into a larger oracle model as a single batch. If the small model&#8217;s predictions align with the larger model&#8217;s output, several tokens can be decoded in a batch. However, if the larger model rejects the tokens predicted by the smaller model, the rest of the batch is discarded, and the inference continues with the larger model. This approach can optimize efficiency but may impact the quality of generated sequences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Inference Architecture: Distributed Computing Power</h3>



<p>GPT-4&#8217;s inference is carried out on a cluster comprising 128 GPUs. Multiple clusters are distributed across various data centers in different locations. The model utilizes 8-way tensor parallelism and 16-way pipeline parallelism to effectively leverage the available computational resources. Each node of 8 GPUs handles approximately 130 billion parameters, accommodating the model&#8217;s overall size. The design of the architecture allows for efficient parallel processing and scalability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dataset Mixture: A Diverse Training Corpus</h3>



<p>The training process for GPT-4 incorporates a mixture of datasets. The model is trained on approximately 13 trillion tokens, with CommonCrawl and RefinedWeb datasets contributing 5 trillion tokens each. Deduplicating tokens from multiple epochs yields a more reasonable estimate of the &#8220;unaccounted for&#8221; tokens, often referred to as the &#8220;secret&#8221; data. Speculations suggest that parts of this data come from sources such as Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and platforms like LibGen, Sci-Hub, and GitHub.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GPT-4&#8217;s Training and Knowledge: A Reflective Illusion</h3>



<p>GPT-4&#8217;s training on an extensive collection of college textbooks, coupled with its ability to answer questions from various domains, creates the illusion of intelligence. This illusion can make it appear knowledgeable in disciplines ranging from computer science to philosophy. Researchers have even attempted to extract memorized parts of books from GPT-4 to better understand its training data. Rumors suggest that the model possesses exceptional familiarity with unique IDs of Project Euler exercises.</p>



<p>In conclusion, GPT-4 represents a significant leap forward in terms of scale, capabilities, and training techniques. Its massive parameter count, mixture of experts model, and efficient inference architecture contribute to its enhanced performance. While the model&#8217;s training process involves a substantial investment, the use of diverse datasets and fine-tuning across multiple domains equips GPT-4 with a broad knowledge base. OpenAI&#8217;s approach to scaling language models demonstrates their commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI research and development.</p>
