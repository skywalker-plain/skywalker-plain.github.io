										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s generally better to qualify a prospect or lead first before giving them a product demo or pitch. This allows you to determine if the prospect is a good fit for your product or service and if they have the potential to become a customer.</p>



<p>Qualifying a lead typically involves gathering information about their needs, budget, timeline, and decision-making process. Once you have this information, you can use it to determine whether your product or service is a good fit for their needs and whether it&#8217;s worth investing time and resources in a demo or pitch.</p>



<p>If the prospect meets your criteria and appears to be a good fit, then you can proceed with a product demo or pitch. This will give you the opportunity to showcase the benefits and features of your product or service and explain how it can meet the prospect&#8217;s needs.</p>



<p>However, if the prospect doesn&#8217;t meet your criteria or appears to be a poor fit for your product or service, then it may be best to move on and focus your efforts on other leads who are more likely to become customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Navigating a difficult / arrogant prospect</h3>



<p>Here are some phrases you can use to encourage the prospect to share more information and engage in a conversation about their needs, even when they are focused on seeing a demo:</p>



<ol>
<li>&#8220;Before we jump into the demo, I&#8217;d love to hear more about your current situation and what you&#8217;re hoping to achieve with our product. Can you tell me a bit more about that?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I completely understand you&#8217;re excited to see our product, but understanding your needs will help us customize the demo to your specific situation. Can you share some more information about your company&#8217;s goals?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to give you a demo that&#8217;s tailored to your specific needs. Can you tell me more about your current workflow and what challenges you&#8217;re currently facing?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;We can definitely show you how our product works, but it would be really helpful to understand more about your company and what you&#8217;re looking for. Can you share some details about your current process and pain points?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to give you a demo, but before we get started, could you give me some more context about your role and how our product would fit into your workflow?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I want to make sure our demo is as useful as possible for you. Can you give me some more information about your decision-making process and what criteria you&#8217;re using to evaluate solutions like ours?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re interested in our product, but to make sure it&#8217;s the right fit for you, I&#8217;d love to hear more about your business and the challenges you&#8217;re facing. Can you share some more information about that?&#8221;</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does the lead qualification happen before or after the discovery call?</h3>



<p>During a discovery call, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to learn more about the lead&#8217;s needs and how your product or service can help solve their problems. However, if the lead doesn&#8217;t meet your qualification criteria, it may not be worth investing the time and resources into a discovery call.</p>



<p>By qualifying leads before the discovery call, you can ensure that you&#8217;re focusing your efforts on those who are more likely to become customers, and that you&#8217;re not wasting time on leads that aren&#8217;t a good fit for your product or service.</p>



<p>When a cold lead asks why you&#8217;re calling and what you have to offer, it&#8217;s important to start by providing a brief introduction and explanation of what your company does, but also to quickly pivot to asking some qualifying questions. Here&#8217;s an example of how you could respond:</p>



<p>&#8220;Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I&#8217;m calling from [Your Company]. We specialize in [Your Product/Service] and I wanted to see if you might be interested in learning more. But before I jump into details, could you tell me a bit more about your current process and the challenges you&#8217;re facing in your industry? This will help me better understand if we might be a good fit for your needs.&#8221;</p>



<p>By starting with a brief introduction and explanation of what your company does, you acknowledge the reason for your call and help the prospect understand why you&#8217;re reaching out. However, by quickly pivoting to asking some qualifying questions, you demonstrate that you&#8217;re interested in understanding their needs and challenges, rather than just pitching your product/service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cold calling rules</h3>



<p>The 3&#215;3 Rule by Trish Bertuzzi: Trish Bertuzzi, author of &#8220;The Sales Development Playbook,&#8221; recommends the 3&#215;3 rule for cold calling. This involves making three calls to the same prospect over three days, leaving a different voicemail message each time. The first message is an introduction and a reason for calling, the second is a reminder of the first message and a new value proposition, and the third is a final reminder and a call-to-action.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Hook, Line, and Sinker&#8221; Method by John Barrows: John Barrows, sales trainer and consultant, recommends the &#8220;hook, line, and sinker&#8221; method for cold calling. The hook is a strong opening statement that grabs the prospect&#8217;s attention, the line is a brief explanation of what you do and why you&#8217;re calling, and the sinker is a question that engages the prospect in a conversation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some cold calling tips shared by sales experts in their interviews:</h3>



<p>&#8220;The goal of the first call should not be to sell, but to get the prospect to engage in a conversation with you.&#8221; &#8211; Jeb Blount</p>



<p>&#8220;Before you make a cold call, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target market and your ideal customer profile.&#8221; &#8211; Jill Konrath</p>



<p>&#8220;Be confident and enthusiastic when making your cold call. People can hear your smile through the phone.&#8221; &#8211; John Barrows</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The paradox</h3>



<p>The fundamental challenge you have to solve is that lead or prospect wants to know what I have to offer, the demo, etc, and on the other hand you want to ask him questions, engage him in conversations, qualify, etc. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">How to deal with this paradox?</h5>



<p>The key to resolving this paradox is to balance the prospect&#8217;s desire to learn about your product or service with your need to gather information and qualify them as a potential customer. Here are a few strategies that can help:</p>



<ol>
<li>it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that interest and let them know that you understand why they&#8217;re curious. You might say something like, &#8220;I appreciate your enthusiasm for our product, and I&#8217;d be happy to show you how it works. But before we dive into the demo, I&#8217;d like to ask you a few questions to make sure that it&#8217;s a good fit for your needs.&#8221;</li>



<li>Provide a high-level overview: Instead of launching directly into a full product demo, you might consider giving the prospect a brief overview of what your product or service does and how it can benefit them. This can help establish context and give them a sense of why they should be interested, without overwhelming them with too much information too quickly.</li>



<li>Ask open-ended questions: One way to engage the prospect in conversation and gather information is to ask open-ended questions that encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings. For example, you might ask, &#8220;Can you tell me more about your current process for [specific task]?&#8221; or &#8220;What are some of the biggest challenges you&#8217;ve faced in [specific area]?&#8221;</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some examples of how sales experts have given a high-level overview and then pivoted to asking questions:</h3>

One of the ways we do that is by providing a powerful software solution that automates many of the tedious manual tasks you may be facing. But before I jump into the specifics of our software, I&#8217;d love to learn more about your current workflow and the challenges you&#8217;re facing.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to do after the discovery call?</h3>



<p>Here are a few examples of emails you could send after a discovery call:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Example 1: Confirming Next Steps</h4>

<p>&#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; is a popular American television series that premiered on AMC in February 2015. It is a prequel to the hit series &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221; and follows the life of the struggling lawyer, Jimmy McGill, who later adopts the moniker Saul Goodman. The show explores Jimmy/Saul&#8217;s transformation from a small-time lawyer to a notorious criminal lawyer who represents some of the most dangerous criminals in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>



<p>The show has been critically acclaimed for its compelling storytelling, complex characters, and outstanding performances by the cast, particularly Bob Odenkirk, who plays the lead role of Jimmy/Saul. The series has also received praise for its attention to detail, cinematography, and music.</p>



<p>Over the years, &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; has won numerous awards and nominations, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>2 Golden Globe nominations for Best Television Series – Drama</li>



<li>7 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Jonathan Banks and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Bob Odenkirk</li>



<li>2 Critics&#8217; Choice Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Jonathan Banks and Best Actor in a Drama Series for Bob Odenkirk</li>



<li>1 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series for Bob Odenkirk</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; has been widely praised for its writing, direction, and performances, and has become a fan favorite among viewers who appreciate its dark humor, compelling characters, and tense, dramatic storylines.</p>



<p>But what I find particularly insightful is the character of Jimmy/Saul, the acting, and learnings that sales and marketing people can take away. So here are some key insights from the serieis.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key Insights</h3>



<p>One key insight into the world of sales and marketing that can be gleaned from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Power of storytelling to build an emotional connection with your clients</h4>



<p>Throughout the show, Jimmy/Saul often tells compelling stories to persuade people to take his side. For example, in season 1, episode 8, Jimmy/Saul is trying to convince a potential client to hire him as their lawyer. He tells the story of a previous case he won, where he represented an elderly woman who had been scammed by a con artist. Jimmy/Saul describes how he was able to track down the con artist and get the woman her money back, painting himself as a hero and instilling confidence in the potential client that he can also solve their legal issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1234"/></figure>



<p>This is a powerful tactic that sales and marketing people can use when talking to prospects. By telling stories that illustrate how their product or service has helped others in similar situations, they can build trust and credibility with the prospect, and increase the likelihood that the prospect will choose to do business with them.</p>



<p>Another key insight that can be gleaned from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; for sales and marketing professionals is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of understanding your audience.</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul often tailors his communication style and approach to the specific person he is trying to persuade. For example, in season 2, episode 6, Jimmy/Saul is trying to convince a group of elderly people to sign up for a retirement home&#8217;s class action lawsuit. He uses a folksy, down-to-earth approach, peppering his speech with references to old TV shows and songs that he knows will resonate with the older demographic.</p>



<p>This is a valuable lesson for sales and marketing people, who should take the time to research and understand their audience before trying to sell them anything. By tailoring your messaging and approach to your audience&#8217;s needs and interests, you can increase the chances of a successful sale or conversion. This can include using language that resonates with their particular industry or talking about specific pain points that you know they are struggling with. By showing that you understand their needs and can provide solutions that are relevant to them, you can build trust and establish a connection that is crucial for successful sales and marketing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1235"/></figure>



<p>Another insight that sales and marketing professionals can learn from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221;: </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The power of word-of-mouth marketing.</h4>



<p>Throughout the show, Jimmy/Saul frequently relies on referrals and personal recommendations from satisfied clients to attract new business. For example, in season 1, episode 5, Jimmy/Saul represents a pair of skateboarders who were injured while filming a video. He wins their case and they become his advocates, spreading the word about his services to their friends and fellow skateboarders.</p>



<p>This is a powerful reminder that word-of-mouth marketing can be one of the most effective ways to attract new customers. By providing excellent service and going above and beyond for your existing clients, you can turn them into brand ambassadors who will recommend your product or service to others. This can include offering exceptional customer service, providing personalized recommendations or solutions, or simply going the extra mile to make sure your clients are satisfied. In today&#8217;s social media-driven world, positive reviews and recommendations from satisfied customers can be more valuable than any other form of advertising.</p>



<p>Another key insight from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; for sales and marketing professionals is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of persistence</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul often faces rejection and setbacks in his attempts to win new clients and cases. However, he never gives up and continues to pursue his goals with determination and creativity. For example, in season 1, episode 3, Jimmy/Saul is trying to convince a potential client to hire him as their lawyer, but the client is initially resistant. Rather than giving up, Jimmy/Saul comes up with a creative plan to win the client over, which involves staging a fake accident and convincing the client that he needs legal representation.</p>



<p>This is a valuable lesson for sales and marketing professionals, who may also face rejection or obstacles in their attempts to win new business. By staying persistent and looking for creative solutions to problems, you can increase your chances of success. This may involve following up with a prospect multiple times, trying different approaches, or finding a way to differentiate your product or service from competitors. While persistence may not always guarantee success, it can be a crucial factor in overcoming obstacles and achieving your goals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of building relationships with your clients.</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul frequently goes above and beyond to build personal connections with his clients, often taking the time to get to know them on a personal level and empathize with their struggles. For example, in season 1, episode 9, Jimmy/Saul represents a woman who is being scammed by a con artist. Rather than just focusing on the legal aspects of the case, Jimmy/Saul takes the time to comfort the woman and provide emotional support, even staying with her overnight to make sure she feels safe.</p>



<p>This is a valuable lesson for sales and marketing professionals, who should strive to build strong relationships with their clients and customers. By taking the time to get to know your clients on a personal level, you can better understand their needs and goals, and tailor your solutions accordingly. This can involve sending personalized messages or recommendations, checking in with clients regularly to see how they are doing, or simply showing genuine interest in their lives and experiences. By building trust and rapport with your clients, you can establish a long-term relationship that is beneficial for both parties.</p>



<p>Another key insight from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; for sales and marketing professionals is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of being adaptable and flexible.</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul often has to pivot and change his approach on the fly to adapt to unexpected situations or new information. For example, in season 4, episode 4, Jimmy/Saul is representing a client who is facing criminal charges. However, he discovers that the client is actually guilty and has lied to him about the details of the case. Rather than giving up, Jimmy/Saul quickly shifts his strategy and comes up with a new plan to negotiate a plea deal for the client.</p>



<p>To do this, Jimmy/Saul used his knowledge of the legal system and his relationships with other lawyers and officials to navigate the negotiation process. He was able to convince the prosecutor that his client was remorseful and willing to cooperate, and to negotiate a deal that would result in a reduced sentence and a chance for his client to turn his life around.</p>



<p>This example highlights the importance of adaptability and flexibility in sales and marketing. Just as Jimmy/Saul was able to pivot his strategy and find a new approach to achieve his goals, sales and marketing professionals may also need to be willing to change course and try new tactics to overcome challenges and achieve success. By staying agile and responsive to new information and changing circumstances, you can increase your chances of achieving your objectives and achieving long-term success.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging social media or personal connections to gain access to key decision-makers at target companies</h4>



<p> In season 1, episode 1, Jimmy/Saul poses as a grieving family member to gain access to a potential client and win his business. He attends a funeral for the deceased, pretending to be an old friend from college. He approaches the grieving widow and strikes up a conversation, eventually revealing that he is a lawyer who can help her with her husband&#8217;s outstanding legal issues.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Creating engaging and informative video content to promote their SAAS solution</h4>



<p>In season 1, episode 4, Jimmy/Saul creates a fake commercial to advertise his legal services on local TV. He hires a film crew and actors to create a commercial that pokes fun at traditional law firm advertising and positions him as a more relatable and approachable lawyer. He then airs the commercial during late-night TV programming, targeting viewers who may be more likely to need legal services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Using humor and empathy to build rapport with prospects and overcome objections</h4>



<p>In season 2, episode 3, Jimmy/Saul uses humor and wit to overcome objections and win over a potential client. He meets with a potential client who is resistant to his legal services, but he uses his charm and wit to make her laugh and build rapport. He also presents a creative solution to her problem that helps her see the value in hiring him.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Using their expertise to provide value to prospects and clients</h4>



<p>In season 3, episode 2, Jimmy/Saul uses his knowledge of legal loopholes to find a way to help a client in a seemingly impossible situation. He researches obscure legal precedents and statutes to find a loophole that allows him to help his client avoid a lengthy prison sentence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thinking creatively about how to connect with prospects and build relationships </h4>



<p>In season 4, episode 2, Jimmy/Saul uses a clever and unconventional approach to win over potential clients at a senior living home. He dons a disguise and poses as a potential resident, gaining access to the facility and building relationships with the residents and staff. He then pitches his legal services to the residents, using his charm and wit to win them over.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Research on the decision-makers at their target companies and finding ways to connect with them on a personal level</h4>
