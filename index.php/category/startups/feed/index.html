<p>Dear fellow entrepreneurs, </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Launching Now Is the Best Advice</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re probably in the midst of launching your own startup. You&#8217;ve got a great idea, you&#8217;ve done some market research, and you&#8217;re eager to get going. Well, my advice to you is simple: launch now. Yes, you heard me right. Launch now. Don&#8217;t wait until you have every detail figured out. Don&#8217;t wait until you have every feature built. Don&#8217;t wait until you have a perfect product. Because the truth is, there is no such thing as a perfect product. You will always find something to improve upon, something to add, something to tweak. So don&#8217;t waste your time trying to achieve the unachievable. Launch now and start building something people want. One example of this is Airbnb. They launched their platform without a mobile app or sophisticated website. They relied on Craigslist to advertise their listings, and they manually handled customer support. Despite these limitations, they were able to build a strong foundation and grow their business. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Build Something People Want by Listening to Your Customers</h3>



<p>Building something people want should be your primary focus. Don&#8217;t get bogged down in building something that you think people should want. A great example of this is Dropbox. Their founders built a simple product that solved a common problem &#8211; file sharing. They listened to their early adopters, and as a result, they were able to create a product that people loved and that quickly grew in popularity.Listen to your customers, take their feedback seriously, and build something that solves their problems. As Steve Jobs once said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.&#8221; So be smart and listen to your customers. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Doing Things That Don&#8217;t Scale in the Early Stages of Your Business</h3>



<p>Do things that don&#8217;t scale. This might seem counterintuitive, but it&#8217;s actually a very smart strategy. When you&#8217;re just starting out, you don&#8217;t need to worry about scaling your operations. Focus on providing a great experience for your early adopters. Reach out to them, talk to them, and learn from them. It&#8217;s like planting a garden by hand. It might be time-consuming, but if you want to create something beautiful, you have to put in the effort. Find the 90 / 10 solution that will satisfy the majority of your customers, and then build from there. One example of this is how Amazon launched with only one product category &#8211; books. They focused on providing the best possible experience for their book customers, and as a result, they were able to create a strong foundation and eventually expand into other product categories. It&#8217;s like baking a cake. You have to focus on getting the base right before you can add the icing on top. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a 90/10 Solution and Starting with a Small Group of Early Adopters</h3>



<p>Speaking of customers, find 10-100 customers who love your product. These are the people who will give you honest feedback, who will recommend your product to their friends and family, and who will help you grow your business. Don&#8217;t worry about trying to get thousands of customers right away. Focus on building a strong foundation with your early adopters, and the rest will come. It&#8217;s like building a campfire. You have to start with a small flame before you can build it up into something bigger. Remember that all startups are badly broken at some point. You will encounter challenges and setbacks along the way. But don&#8217;t let that discourage you. Keep pushing forward, keep iterating, and keep learning from your mistakes. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focusing on Writing Code and Talking to Users</h3>



<p>Write code and talk to users. These two activities should be your primary focus. Don&#8217;t get bogged down in administrative tasks or endless meetings. Stay focused on building a great product and talking to your customers. And remember, it&#8217;s not your money. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Getting Too Attached to Your Ideas or Business</h3>



<p>Don&#8217;t get too attached to your ideas or your business. Be open to feedback and be willing to pivot if necessary. Growth is the result of a great product, not the precursor. Don&#8217;t scale your team or your product until you have built something people want. It&#8217;s tempting to try to grow your business as quickly as possible, but that&#8217;s not always the best strategy. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focusing on Building a Strong Foundation Before Scaling</h3>



<p>Focus on building a strong foundation first, and then worry about scaling. Valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success. Don&#8217;t get too caught up in valuations or fundraising. These things can be important, but they don&#8217;t necessarily determine the success of your business. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Long Negotiations and Big Company Corporate Development Queries</h3>



<p>Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can. These deals can be tempting, but they can also be a drain on your resources. Focus on building a strong foundation with your early adopters before worrying about big deals. Avoid big company corporate development queries. These can be time-consuming and distracting. Focus on building your business, not on corporate development. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers. </h3>



<p>Conferences can be a great way to meet potential customers, but they can also be a waste of time and money. Be strategic in your approach to conferences. In the early stages of your business, focus on doing things that don&#8217;t scale</p>



<p>and lastly remember </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Valuations Do Not Equal Success or Probability of Success</p></blockquote></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>



<p>Launching your startup now is the best advice you can take. Don&#8217;t wait until everything is perfect. The most important thing is to build something that people want. Listen to your customers, and focus on creating an excellent experience for your early adopters. Don&#8217;t get caught up in valuations or fundraising. Remember that all startups face challenges and setbacks, but keep pushing forward.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>I always struggle to stay focussed. Often, I find myself spending time on activities that don’t yield the highest return. Development is secondary and building the right it, iterating fast, and getting in touch with users who will pay for your software product is the ultimate bottleneck at least for people like me. To address this problem I am making a list of activities that other notable and even lesser known startups did to hack or achieve growth and product market fit. My main goal here is that I can daily or bi-weekly review this list to keep my startup efforts on track and ensure that I am spending my time on the right things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Startup Metrics, OKRs, and KPIs</strong></h2>



<p>The AARRR framework is a customer acquisition model that stands for: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue. It helps startups to understand the key performance indicators (KPIs) that they need to track in order to grow their customer base. Here is a table that provides example KPIs for each component of the AARRR framework:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>KPI</strong></td><td><strong>Explanation</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Acquisition</td><td>Traffic</td><td>The number of visitors to your website or app</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Conversion Rate</td><td>The percentage of visitors who take a desired action (e.g. sign up or make a purchase)</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Cost per Acquisition (CPA)</td><td>The cost of acquiring a new customer</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Bounce Rate</td><td>The percentage of visitors who leave your website or app after only visiting one page</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Click-through Rate (CTR)</td><td>The percentage of visitors who click on a specific link or button on your website or app</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Lead-to-customer Ratio</td><td>The ratio of leads generated to customers acquired</td></tr><tr><td>Activation</td><td>Activation Rate</td><td>The percentage of new users who take a desired action (e.g. complete a tutorial or make a purchase)</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Engagement Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who are active in your product</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Feature Adoption</td><td>The percentage of users who have adopted a specific feature or set of features</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Time to First Value (TTV)</td><td>The time it takes for a new user to generate value for the business</td></tr><tr><td>Retention</td><td>Retention Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who continue to use your product over a specific period of time</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Churn Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who stop using your product over a specific period of time</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Repeat Purchase Rate</td><td>The percentage of customers who make repeat purchases</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Time to Churn</td><td>The time it takes for a customer to stop using the product or service</td></tr><tr><td>Referral</td><td>Referral Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who refer others to your product</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</td><td>A measure of customer loyalty and advocacy</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Referral Conversion Rate</td><td>The percentage of referred users who convert into customers</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Referral Revenue</td><td>The revenue generated from referred customers</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</td><td>The amount of revenue generated by your product on a monthly basis</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Lifetime Value (LTV)</td><td>The total revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Average Revenue per User (ARPU)</td><td>The average amount of revenue generated per user</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Gross Margin</td><td>The difference between the revenue and cost of goods sold (COGS)</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</td><td>The cost of acquiring a new customer, including marketing and sales expenses</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Lifetime Value to CAC Ratio (LTV:CAC)</td><td>The ratio of a customer&#8217;s lifetime value to the cost of acquiring them</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

It is important to note there that the marketing message focusses on the broader problem. Your startup might be building an AI solution that does unit test case generation but you should talk about the problem or pain point which is faster deployment, bug free stable software.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>I hope this document or guide serves as a means to help you achieve growth, product market fit and more importantly stay focussed. Startups are not a sprint but rather a marathon. Staying focussed, disciplined and consistent are paramount. In this guide we covered the key components to help you achieve that goal, the startup metric framework, KPIs, OKR, and Task Ideas, and made a list of things that you should be busy doing. Plus the guide has some motivation sections to help ensure that you don’t loose sight of how other startups got there.</p>

<p>This is a common problem that people face in finding their passion or purpose. I am going to talk about an easy two-step process to find your passion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: identify what you are naturally good at.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/d0d712e6-66e1-4304-8be8-392369d42a98-38697-00001702d135c5f3_file-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-897"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Steve Jobs was naturally good at making things simple. Elon Musk is naturally good at being an engineer. </p>



<p>Please note that while answering this question for yourself the answer can’t be that “I am naturally good at baseball, basketball, etc”. If that is where your answer is going then look deeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>But how do you find what you are naturally good at?</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.1: Simply observe what you spend time doing. </h4>



<p>Write daily in detail about things that you are spending time on. For instance, I wrote yesterday “spent time comparing stocks and their PE ratio”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/12a497f6-797d-4ed8-822a-03d4fe83157c-38697-000017049634ab52_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-899"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Then over say a month, when you analyze you will see both what you are naturally good at and the challenges in those areas. </p>



<p>For me the analysis was I spend time meditating, writing blog posts, sculpting my body, web product development, etc.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.2: Look deeper</h4>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/59b8f405-191b-4eda-a01a-1808f4b2c4fa-38697-00001788f3a27a65_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-902"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Pick each area and note the why? </p>



<p>For example, say you are naturally good at cooking but the underlying skill will be that you are naturally good at figuring out how things are going to combine and what results they create.</p>



<p>For me. The why for Mediation was? I am inclined towards the search for a calmer mind. Why Web product development? means that I like making complex things simple and the nature of products I build are complex and difficult so I need engineering challenges as well.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: not all areas you spend time on are your passions if they won&#8217;t have a good “Why”. People are forced into some jobs and activities but you can look at what aspect of that work you excel at.</p>



<p>Often your friends and colleagues are a good source to ask what they think makes you unique.</p>



<p>By now you should have found what you are naturally good at and also what your passions are. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Find areas that need your natural skill, and passion.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bdd36f67-cf3a-4a3d-8957-eb9d48ad92c6-38697-0000178a517f703f_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-903"/></figure></div>


<p>Phones, laptops, and music players are complex, so Steve Jobs chose that market to apply his natural skill of making things simple.</p>



<p>Electric cars, solar panels, and rockets require a lot of engineering so Elon Musk chose that market to apply his natural skills and love of engineering.</p>



<p>In my case, I am naturally good at making complex things simple. Stock research and analyzing a company is very complex, I plan to apply my skills to make this complex process simpler.</p>



<p>At this point your detailed observations will tell you the unsolved problems in the area you picked. For me, it was no easy way to compare stocks, and too much information, and opinions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ef38af96-53a0-4647-930b-9810d7368ae4-38697-0000178b2e1c07d5_file-300x225.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-904"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>To conclude, to find your passion, discover what you are naturally good at by observing what you do each day. Then try to find which market needs your skills the most. And then just commit yourself to solving problems in that market by doing what you are naturally good at.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>By the way, this is called finding product founder market fit.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In my next post, I am going to give practical advice on how to innovate in the area you committed to devote your next 10 years to, stay tuned …</p>

<p>Running a startup on a bootstrap budget is about focus, because you do not have resources to dedicate on things that are not important. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image_3afe62-42 size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DALL·E-2022-10-31-15.18.20-a-startup-founder-struggling-to-run-his-company-on-a-tight-budget-and-without-any-funding-digital-art.png" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-778" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But, how can startups achieve focus? </h2>



<p>One critical way to achieve focus is measurement. I think it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re running a small company that you establish what you are trying to accomplish, what&#8217;s your intended outcome? </p>



<p>For example, say that startup is about, issuing documents. Documents that would ultimately be shared by the recipient. For example, let&#8217;s say your company is a platform that issues digital credentials (like certificates, and badges), and ultimately received by people and they share them on their social media handles like WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. </p>



<p>So, for a company like this, first ask yourself a question like</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What is my intended outcome? What do I want to achieve? </p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/30fa0f26-f9a6-4760-92d4-0b2b65deda92-31072-0000052ba3c4a245_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-773"/></figure></div>


<p>The answer here is that I want to increase the number of shares, documents that are shared and I want to increase the number of use of those documents. Now next question, you ask is </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What are the various steps in the process when it comes to achieving the intended outcome? </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The steps in the process are, for example going to number of documents that are actually issued using your platform, the number of documents that are received, sent, the number of documents that are opened, and then the number of documents that are shared. </p>



<p>So the idea here is that measure each step in the in the process of achieving the outcome that you are trying to achieve and try to ensure that people are held accountable. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0fd72e47-5b28-493d-9d5e-7e6c098b4f55-31072-00000529e0068ea6_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-772"/></figure></div>


<p>So identify individuals in your organization who are held accountable for each of those metrics. In the start of a company a bootstrapped one, with very few people, it might be that you are responsible for multiple metrics down the funnel. </p>



<p>But in a slightly bigger organization, you will have individuals accountable for these steps, for example, marketing would be responsible for increasing the number of documents issued and customer support might be, responsible for getting a document opened. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>On a daily basis, you should review what your performance goal is and keep on every day, stare at the value creation objective for your end users. In my next post I will be discussing how a bootstrapped startup can do marketing on a tight budget, so stay tuned or subscribe.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to come up with startup ideas: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1692.png" alt="" class="wp-image-759"/></figure>



<p>1. Look at what&#8217;s already out there and find a way to improve it </p>



<p>2. Solve a problem that you or someone you know is experiencing </p>



<p>This is the common advice. The problem I find is that this approach gives you too many ideas. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can you find ideas that you have passion for?</h2>



<p></p>



<p>So one secret to finding ideas that you have a passion for is to focus on things that you do daily. </p>



<p>For example, If you spend a lot of time say in investment just observe, what are the things that you feel like doing and you&#8217;re not able to do? What do you spend more time doing? </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1693-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-762 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;re spending a lot of time or effort in figuring out comparing a stock or reading the transcript report, just observe, figure out what while reading the transcript, what are you trying to get out of it and see if you can fundamentally come up or use a disruptive technology to to eliminate that.</p>
</div></div>



<p>See, there is always a market so you want to look at current market for a product like this would be that somebody would pay for. In this case, let&#8217;s say a financial analyst is going through these talks and identifying what exactly is the transcript earning calls transcript is saying, What if you could develop technology that could do the same? What if it is not just technology, what if you could, connect people to other people who can potentially help you accomplish this and make them do things for each other so that it&#8217;s gets the same job done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>To conclude, a quick tip, when the day ends, or maybe the start of the day, just simply write all your observations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1694.png" alt="" class="wp-image-765"/></figure>



<p>Write what you saw, what you spent more time on, resist the temptation to get ideas or judge your observations. Resist the temptation to come up the solution to the problem, Just take note of the emotion. Notice what is happening. Soon you will discover a theme emerging, an opportunity will emerge.</p>



<p>Good news is that this opportunity will be something you have passion towards. In my next blog I will cover what other things to ensure when you are evaluating this opportunity, so stay tuned.</p>



<p></p>
