<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>I always struggle to stay focussed. Often, I find myself spending time on activities that don’t yield the highest return. Development is secondary and building the right it, iterating fast, and getting in touch with users who will pay for your software product is the ultimate bottleneck at least for people like me. To address this problem I am making a list of activities that other notable and even lesser known startups did to hack or achieve growth and product market fit. My main goal here is that I can daily or bi-weekly review this list to keep my startup efforts on track and ensure that I am spending my time on the right things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Startup Metrics, OKRs, and KPIs</strong></h2>



<p>The AARRR framework is a customer acquisition model that stands for: Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, and Revenue. It helps startups to understand the key performance indicators (KPIs) that they need to track in order to grow their customer base. Here is a table that provides example KPIs for each component of the AARRR framework:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>KPI</strong></td><td><strong>Explanation</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Acquisition</td><td>Traffic</td><td>The number of visitors to your website or app</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Conversion Rate</td><td>The percentage of visitors who take a desired action (e.g. sign up or make a purchase)</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Cost per Acquisition (CPA)</td><td>The cost of acquiring a new customer</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Bounce Rate</td><td>The percentage of visitors who leave your website or app after only visiting one page</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Click-through Rate (CTR)</td><td>The percentage of visitors who click on a specific link or button on your website or app</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Lead-to-customer Ratio</td><td>The ratio of leads generated to customers acquired</td></tr><tr><td>Activation</td><td>Activation Rate</td><td>The percentage of new users who take a desired action (e.g. complete a tutorial or make a purchase)</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Engagement Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who are active in your product</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Feature Adoption</td><td>The percentage of users who have adopted a specific feature or set of features</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Time to First Value (TTV)</td><td>The time it takes for a new user to generate value for the business</td></tr><tr><td>Retention</td><td>Retention Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who continue to use your product over a specific period of time</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Churn Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who stop using your product over a specific period of time</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Repeat Purchase Rate</td><td>The percentage of customers who make repeat purchases</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Time to Churn</td><td>The time it takes for a customer to stop using the product or service</td></tr><tr><td>Referral</td><td>Referral Rate</td><td>The percentage of users who refer others to your product</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</td><td>A measure of customer loyalty and advocacy</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Referral Conversion Rate</td><td>The percentage of referred users who convert into customers</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Referral Revenue</td><td>The revenue generated from referred customers</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</td><td>The amount of revenue generated by your product on a monthly basis</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Lifetime Value (LTV)</td><td>The total revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Average Revenue per User (ARPU)</td><td>The average amount of revenue generated per user</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Gross Margin</td><td>The difference between the revenue and cost of goods sold (COGS)</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</td><td>The cost of acquiring a new customer, including marketing and sales expenses</td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td>Lifetime Value to CAC Ratio (LTV:CAC)</td><td>The ratio of a customer&#8217;s lifetime value to the cost of acquiring them</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>I hope this document or guide serves as a means to help you achieve growth, product market fit and more importantly stay focussed. Startups are not a sprint but rather a marathon. Staying focussed, disciplined and consistent are paramount. In this guide we covered the key components to help you achieve that goal, the startup metric framework, KPIs, OKR, and Task Ideas, and made a list of things that you should be busy doing. Plus the guide has some motivation sections to help ensure that you don’t loose sight of how other startups got there.</p>
