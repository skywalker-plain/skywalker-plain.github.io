<p>Training large language models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 is an expensive task that requires a lot of computational resources, time, and money. In this blog post, we will discuss some cost-saving strategies that can be used while training these models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Training Large Language Models is So Expensive?</h3>



<p>Large language models are expensive to train because they require vast amounts of computational resources, such as GPU/CPU, memory, and storage. Training a language model on a single machine can take days or even weeks, depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. The cost of renting these resources from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be quite high. To put it in perspective, training GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, would cost approximately $4.6 million on AWS.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Spot Instances as a Solution</h3>



<p>AWS offers a cost-effective solution to reduce the cost of training large language models &#8211; Spot instances. Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that are available for purchase at a significantly lower price than on-demand instances. AWS offers these instances at a discount of up to 90% compared to on-demand instances. Spot instances are a great option for training large language models since the training process is not time-sensitive, and the task can be divided into smaller chunks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Spot Instances</h3>



<p>To use Spot instances, you need to request them using the AWS Management Console or the AWS SDK. Spot instances are available until the price exceeds your maximum bid, at which point the instance is terminated. However, using spot instances has its challenges. The instance can be terminated at any time, causing the work to be lost, and the training process to start from scratch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a Boot Snapshot Volume</h3>



<p>To prevent losing work when a Spot instance is terminated, you can create a boot snapshot volume. A boot snapshot volume contains the operating system, the application, and any data that was present on the instance. When a new instance is created, this volume can be attached, allowing you to resume work from where you left off. By doing this, you can significantly reduce the time and money spent on training large language models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges with Spot Instances and GPU Limits</h3>



<p>While Spot instances are a cost-effective solution for training large language models, AWS and other cloud companies impose limits on the type of spot instances that have GPU, making it challenging to procure the necessary resources to train these models. These limits can significantly impact the training time and, consequently, the overall cost of the project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Requesting a Limit Increase</h3>



<p>To overcome this challenge, you can request a limit increase for the GPU instances from AWS or the cloud provider you are using. The process involves submitting a support ticket requesting an increase in the limit for the specific instance type. AWS has a dedicated portal for requesting limit increases, making the process more streamlined.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Getting Your Limit Increase Approved</h3>



<p>Getting a limit increase approved can be a daunting task, but there are ways to increase the chances of approval. Here are some tips to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Justify your request &#8211; provide a detailed explanation of why you need a limit increase, including the nature of your workload, the size of your dataset, and the complexity of the model.</li>



<li>Demonstrate cost optimization &#8211; show that using Spot instances is a cost-effective solution compared to using on-demand instances, which can help justify the increase in limit.</li>



<li>Highlight past successes &#8211; showcase past successes in training large language models, using similar or the same resources, to demonstrate your ability to manage the workload effectively.</li>



<li>Be specific &#8211; provide detailed information on the exact type of instance you need and the number required to complete the task.</li>



<li>Plan ahead &#8211; request the limit increase well in advance to allow enough time for approval and procurement of the required resources.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Size of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>



<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or ChatGPT can get extremely large, often requiring hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of storage space. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and requires 800 GB of storage space. The size of these models makes it challenging to move data from one instance to another, increasing the overall cost and time required to train the models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges of Moving Data between Instances</h3>



<p>Moving data between instances can be a time-consuming and expensive process. It involves copying large amounts of data over the network, which can take hours or even days, depending on the size of the data and the network speed. Additionally, copying data can also incur additional costs, such as network bandwidth fees, which can add up quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use object storage</h3>



<p>Storing data in object storage services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage can make it easier to move data between instances. Object storage services allow you to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, reducing the time and cost of moving data between instances.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Connecting to a Spot Instance using SSH: Challenges and Solutions</h3>



<p>When using Spot instances for training large language models, connecting to the instance using SSH can be a challenge.</p>



<p>Firewall settings: Firewall settings can prevent you from connecting to your Spot instance using SSH. If your firewall is not set up correctly, you may receive a &#8220;Connection Refused&#8221; error when trying to connect to the instance.</p>



<p>Solution: To overcome this challenge, ensure that the security group settings for your Spot instance allow incoming SSH traffic. You can do this by adding a rule to the security group to allow incoming traffic on port 22, which is the default port used for SSH.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Max Spot Request Count Exceeded: Causes and Solutions</h3>



<p>Another challenge that can occur when using Spot instances for training large language models is the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error. This error occurs when you have submitted the maximum number of Spot instance requests that you can submit in a specific period.</p>



<p>Here are some common causes of the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error and ways to avoid it:</p>



<ol>
<li>AWS account limits: Your AWS account may have a limit on the number of Spot instance requests that you can submit in a specific period.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To avoid this error, you can request a limit increase from AWS. You may need to provide information on how you plan to use the additional requests and the expected workload. If your request is approved, you can submit more requests and continue your training.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Spot instance launch frequency: When using Spot instances, there is a limit on how frequently you can launch new instances. If you exceed this limit, you may receive the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To avoid this error, you can adjust the frequency of Spot instance launches. This can include launching instances less frequently or using tools like EC2 Auto Scaling to launch new instances based on workload and availability.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Spot instance termination: Similar to the &#8220;Max Spot Instance Count Exceeded&#8221; error, the risk of Spot instance termination can also cause the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error. When a Spot instance is terminated, it counts as a new request.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To avoid this error, you can use the same strategies as mentioned before to manage the risk of Spot instance termination. This can include launching a mix of Spot and On-Demand instances or using tools like EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain a minimum number of running instances.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Picking the Right AMI with Drivers Installed: Challenges and Solutions</h3>



<p>When training large language models using Spot instances, it&#8217;s important to choose the right Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that includes the necessary drivers installed. This can be a challenging task, but there are solutions to help streamline the process.</p>



<p>Here are some common challenges when picking the right AMI with drivers installed and ways to overcome them:</p>



<ol>
<li>Finding the right AMI: With so many different AMIs available on the AWS Marketplace, it can be challenging to find the one that includes the specific drivers required for your workload.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: One solution is to use AWS Deep Learning AMIs, which include popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. These AMIs also include pre-installed drivers for popular GPUs like NVIDIA, making it easier to get started with training large language models.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Customizing the AMI: In some cases, you may need to customize the AMI to include additional drivers or software required for your specific workload.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To customize an AMI, you can use the AWS Systems Manager to create a custom image that includes the necessary drivers and software. This image can then be used to launch Spot instances for your training workload.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Keeping drivers up to date: As new versions of drivers are released, it can be challenging to keep your AMI up to date with the latest drivers.</li>



<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To keep your AMI up to date with the latest drivers, you can use automation tools like AWS Systems Manager Automation to automate the process of updating the drivers. This can help ensure that your AMI is always up to date and optimized for your training workload.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>



<p>In this post, we discussed the cost-saving strategies for training large language models like ChatGPT/GPT-4 using AWS Spot instances. We first explained why training large language models can be expensive and gave examples of how expensive it can get. We then talked about how Spot instances can be an effective solution for cost-saving and how creating a boot snapshot volume can help resume work when a new instance is created.</p>



<p>We also addressed challenges like AWS imposing limits on the type of spot instances that have GPUs, connecting to the spot instance using SSH, and avoiding the &#8220;Max Spot Instance Count Exceeded&#8221; and &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; errors. Lastly, we talked about the importance of choosing the right AMI with drivers installed and provided solutions to overcome the challenges of finding the right AMI and keeping drivers up to date.</p>



<p>In conclusion, training large language models can be a costly process, but using AWS Spot instances, creating a boot snapshot volume, and choosing the right AMI with drivers installed can help optimize cost and performance. Additionally, it is important to plan and manage the availability of Spot instances and minimize the risk of errors to ensure a smooth training process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As more and more businesses migrate to the cloud, optimizing cloud costs has become an essential part of managing their cloud infrastructure. In this article, we will discuss some cost-saving strategies for AWS that can help businesses reduce their cloud costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Use the cost explorer to discover the services that are taking most of your costs</h4>



<p>The cost explorer is a tool in AWS that allows users to analyze and visualize their AWS costs and usage. It can help businesses identify which services are consuming the most resources and costing the most money. By analyzing this data, businesses can make informed decisions about which services to optimize or even shut down to reduce their costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Shut down inactive EC2 instances</h4>



<p>EC2 instances are a significant cost in AWS, and businesses can save money by shutting down instances that are not being used. This can be achieved by setting up an email alert that informs the user if an instance is idle for greater than x% of the time. The user can then decide to shut down the instance manually or automate the process using AWS Lambda.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: If you are using ECS, Adjust ECS task definitions based on CPU and Memory utilization</h4>



<p>ECS is a container orchestration service in AWS that allows businesses to run and scale containerized applications. By analyzing the CPU and memory utilization of the tasks in the service, businesses can adjust the task definitions of the compute to have lesser CPUs or memory, reducing the cost of the service.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Move from ELB to Application Load Balancer</h4>



<p>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a service in AWS that distributes incoming traffic to multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. However, the cost of ELB can be significant, and businesses can save money by moving to Application Load Balancer (ALB), which offers more advanced features at a lower cost.</p>



<p>Pros of using ALB include:</p>



<ul>
<li>More granular routing options</li>



<li>Better support for containerized applications</li>



<li>Native support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket protocols</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Consider using alternatives like NGINX for load balancing</h4>



<p>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and NGINX are both popular load balancing solutions, but they differ in their approach and capabilities. Here is a comparison table that highlights the differences between ELB and NGINX:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>ELB</th><th>NGINX</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cost</td><td>Can be expensive for larger deployments</td><td>Open-source, free, and paid options</td></tr><tr><td>Configuration</td><td>Limited configuration options</td><td>Flexible and customizable</td></tr><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>Can scale up and down automatically</td><td>Can scale up and down manually</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>Can handle high traffic volumes</td><td>Fast and efficient, high performance</td></tr><tr><td>SSL/TLS Offloading</td><td>Supports SSL/TLS offloading</td><td>Supports SSL/TLS offloading</td></tr><tr><td>Health Checks</td><td>Supports basic health checks</td><td>Supports advanced health checks</td></tr><tr><td>Protocols</td><td>Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP</td><td>Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP</td></tr><tr><td>Customization</td><td>Limited customization options</td><td>Highly customizable</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As you can see, both ELB and NGINX have their own strengths and weaknesses. ELB is a managed service, which means that AWS handles the infrastructure and management of the load balancer. However, this comes at a cost, and ELB can be expensive for larger deployments.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to setup NGINX for load balancing?</h4>



<p>To set up NGINX for load balancing and auto scaling with ECS, businesses can follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch an ECS cluster and service</li>



<li>Create a task definition with the NGINX container image</li>



<li>Configure NGINX to load balance requests to the ECS service</li>



<li>Set up auto scaling policies for the ECS service based on CPU or memory utilization</li>
</ul>



<ol start="7">
<li>Explore AWS Route 53 DNS-based load balancing</li>
</ol>



<p>AWS Route 53 is a DNS service that can be used to route traffic to multiple AWS resources, including EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. Businesses with a small number of instances can use Route 53’s DNS-based load balancing to route traffic to their instances, reducing the cost of ELB or ALB.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Consider using Route 53 DNS based Load Balancing</h4>



<p>If you have a small number of instances, you can use AWS Route 53 DNS-based load balancing to route traffic to your instances. This can be a cost-effective option for smaller applications. A tutorial with sample code can help you set up this service and optimize your usage of it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">To set up Route 53 DNS-based load balancing, businesses can follow these steps:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Create a Route 53 hosted zone</li>



<li>Add DNS records for the resources to be load balanced</li>



<li>Create a health check for the resources</li>



<li>Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the healthy resources</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure NGINX for load balancing and auto scaling if you are using ECS:</h4>



<ol>
<li>Launch an Amazon ECS cluster:</li>
</ol>



<p>First, launch an Amazon ECS cluster using the ECS optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI). You can follow the instructions in the Amazon ECS documentation to create an ECS cluster.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Create an ECS service:</li>
</ol>



<p>Next, create an ECS service that will run your application. You can follow the instructions in the Amazon ECS documentation to create an ECS service.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Install NGINX:</li>
</ol>



<p>Once your ECS cluster and service are up and running, you can install NGINX on an EC2 instance that will act as the load balancer. You can follow the instructions in the NGINX documentation to install NGINX on an EC2 instance.</p>



<ol start="4">
<li>Configure NGINX:</li>
</ol>



<p>Next, you need to configure NGINX to act as the load balancer for your ECS service. You can do this by creating an NGINX configuration file that specifies the IP addresses and ports of your ECS tasks.</p>



<p>Example of SAMPLE NGINIX configuration file</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>http {
    upstream ecs_cluster {
        server &lt;ecs_task_ip_address_1&gt;:&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;;
        server &lt;ecs_task_ip_address_2&gt;:&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;;
        server &lt;ecs_task_ip_address_3&gt;:&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;;
    }
 
    server {
        listen 80;
 
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://ecs_cluster;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>



<p>In this configuration file, replace <code>&lt;ecs_task_ip_address&gt;</code> with the IP address of your ECS tasks, and <code>&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;</code> with the port number that your tasks are running on.</p>



<p></p>



<ol start="5">
<li>Configure auto scaling:</li>
</ol>



<p>Finally, you can configure auto scaling for your ECS service by creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that triggers when your ECS tasks exceed a certain CPU utilization threshold. When the alarm is triggered, it can automatically launch new ECS tasks to handle the increased load.</p>



<p>You can follow the instructions in the Amazon ECS documentation to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm and configure auto scaling for your ECS service.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it! With NGINX, you can configure load balancing and auto scaling for your ECS service to handle increased traffic and demand.</p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A target tracking scaling policy for an ECS service</h4>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how you can create an Application Auto Scaling policy for scaling ECS tasks:</p>



<ol>
<li>Define a scalable target:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "ecs_target" {
  max_capacity       = 10
  min_capacity       = 1
  resource_id        = "service/${aws_ecs_service.my_service.name}"
  scalable_dimension = "ecs:service:DesiredCount"
  service_namespace  = "ecs"
}</code></pre>



<p>This block of code defines an Application Auto Scaling target for an ECS service. The <code>resource_id</code> attribute specifies the ECS service to scale, while the <code>max_capacity</code> and <code>min_capacity</code> attributes define the maximum and minimum number of tasks to run.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Define a scaling policy:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_appautoscaling_policy" "ecs_policy" {
  name               = "ecs-scaling-policy"
  policy_type        = "TargetTrackingScaling"
  resource_id        = "${aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.id}"
  scalable_dimension = "ecs:service:DesiredCount"

  target_tracking_scaling_policy_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization"
    }
    target_value = 60.0
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This block of code defines an Application Auto Scaling policy for an ECS service. The <code>policy_type</code> attribute specifies that this is a target tracking scaling policy, which adjusts the number of tasks to maintain a target value for a specified metric. In this case, we are using the <code>ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization</code> metric and setting a target value of 60%. This means that Application Auto Scaling will automatically adjust the number of tasks to maintain a CPU utilization of around 60%.</p>



<p>3. Attach the policy to the target:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_appautoscaling_policy_attachment" "ecs_attachment" {
  policy_arn = "${aws_appautoscaling_policy.ecs_policy.arn}"
  target_arn = "${aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.arn}"
}</code></pre>



<p>This block of code attaches the Application Auto Scaling policy to the ECS service target.</p>



<p>With this setup, Application Auto Scaling will automatically adjust the number of ECS tasks running in response to changes in the specified metric (in this case, CPU utilization). This allows your application to automatically scale up and down to handle varying workloads without requiring manual intervention.</p>



<p>Note that you can customize the metrics and target values to suit your specific use case. You can also create multiple Application Auto Scaling policies for the same target, each with different metrics and target values.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Configure NGINX to act as a load balancer</h4>



<p>To configure NGINX to act as a load balancer, you can follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Install NGINX: You can install NGINX on your server by using your package manager. For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you can use the following command to install NGINX:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
</code></pre>



<p>Configure NGINX as a load balancer: You can configure NGINX to act as a load balancer by editing the <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> file. Here is an example configuration for a simple load balancer that balances requests between two backend servers:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>http {
    upstream backend {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>



<p>In this configuration, the <code>upstream</code> directive defines a group of backend servers, and the <code>proxy_pass</code> directive in the <code>location</code> block directs requests to the backend servers.</p>



<p>Restart NGINX: After editing the configuration file, you need to restart NGINX to apply the changes. You can use the following command to restart NGINX:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo systemctl restart nginx</code></pre>



<p>Test the load balancer: To test the load balancer, you can use a tool like <code>curl</code> to send requests to the server. For example, you can use the following command to send a request to the load balancer:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>curl http://example.com</code></pre>



<p>You should see a response from one of the backend servers.</p>



<p>Configure ECS with task definitions and auto scaling</p>



<p>To configure ECS with task definitions and auto scaling, you can follow these general steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a task definition: A task definition is a blueprint for how to run a specific Docker container within a task. It specifies the Docker image to use, how much CPU and memory to allocate to the task, and other configuration details. You can create a task definition using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</li>



<li>Create a service: A service is a long-running task that is automatically started and stopped by ECS. A service is associated with a task definition, and it can be configured to run a specific number of tasks (called the desired count). You can create a service using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</li>



<li>Configure auto scaling: You can use the AWS Application Auto Scaling service to set up auto scaling for your ECS services. Auto scaling allows you to automatically increase or decrease the number of tasks in your service based on metrics like CPU usage or memory usage. To configure auto scaling, you&#8217;ll need to create an auto scaling target and a scaling policy. You can do this using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how to create an ECS service with task definitions and auto scaling using the AWS Management Console:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a task definition:
<ul>
<li>Go to the Amazon ECS console and choose &#8220;Task Definitions&#8221; from the left navigation pane.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create new Task Definition&#8221; and select &#8220;EC2&#8221; or &#8220;Fargate&#8221; depending on your requirements.</li>



<li>Configure the task definition details like the container image, CPU, memory, port mappings, etc.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create&#8221; to save the task definition.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Create a service:
<ul>
<li>From the ECS console, select &#8220;Clusters&#8221; from the left navigation pane and choose the cluster you want to use.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create Service&#8221; and configure the service details like the task definition, desired count, and load balancer settings.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create Service&#8221; to save the service.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Configure auto scaling:
<ul>
<li>From the Amazon ECS console, choose &#8220;Clusters&#8221; from the left navigation pane and select the cluster you want to use.</li>



<li>Choose the &#8220;Services&#8221; tab and select the service you want to set up auto scaling for.</li>



<li>Choose the &#8220;Auto Scaling&#8221; tab and select &#8220;Configure Auto Scaling.&#8221;</li>



<li>Choose the metrics to use for scaling, such as CPU utilization or memory usage.</li>



<li>Configure the scaling policy, such as the minimum and maximum number of tasks to run.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create&#8221; to save the auto scaling configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>With these steps completed, ECS will automatically start and stop tasks as needed based on the scaling policies you&#8217;ve configured.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Here is an example Terraform code for configuring an ECS service to use the target group:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">resource "aws_ecs_service" "example" {
  name            = "example-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.example.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.example.arn
  desired_count   = 2
  
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.example.arn
    container_name   = "example-container"
    container_port   = 80
  }
}
</pre>



<p>here is an example of how to create an <code>aws_lb_target_group</code> resource in Terraform:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_lb_target_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-target-group"
  port        = 80
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.example.id

  health_check {
    path     = "/"
    protocol = "HTTP"
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This creates an <code>aws_lb_target_group</code> resource named &#8220;example-target-group&#8221; listening on port 80 using the HTTP protocol, and performing a health check by sending an HTTP request to the root path of the target. The target group is associated with the VPC identified by the <code>aws_vpc.example.id</code> variable.</p>
