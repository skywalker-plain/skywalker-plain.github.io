In addition, well-designed images and graphics can help to strengthen the brand&#8217;s visual identity and make the content more memorable.types of images and graphics that can be used in product marketing</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Various types of images and graphics that can be used in product marketing</h4>



<p>There are many different types of images and graphics that can be used in product marketing, including:</p>



<ol>
<li>Product photos: These are images of the product itself, either in isolation or in use. Product photos can help to show the product&#8217;s features and benefits and give the audience a better idea of what it looks like and how it works.</li>



<li>Screenshots: These are images that show the product in action, such as a screen shot of the product&#8217;s interface or a specific feature. Screenshots can help to demonstrate the product&#8217;s capabilities and give the audience a more detailed understanding of how it works.</li>



<li>Infographics: These are visual representations of information or data, such as statistics or processes. Infographics can help to make complex information more easily understandable and can be used to highlight the product&#8217;s key features and benefits.</li>



<li>Charts and graphs: These are visual representations of data or trends, such as bar graphs or pie charts. Charts and graphs can help to show the product&#8217;s performance or effectiveness and can be used to compare it to competitors.</li>



<li>Illustrations and icons: These are visual elements that can be used to add interest or emphasis to the content. Illustrations and icons can help to clarify or explain certain concepts and can be used to make the content more engaging and visually appealing.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges in designing image or graphics for your blog post.</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/eaf42cd7-5c9c-4971-a011-4bd26c87e99a-33129-00001336d89342c9_file-1024x701.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-934"/></figure>



<p>When working with a graphic designer to create images or graphics for a blog post, some of the challenges that may arise include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Communicating the desired design: It can be challenging to effectively communicate the desired design to the graphic designer, especially if the blog post author is not familiar with graphic design principles or terminology. This may require providing detailed instructions, examples, or inspiration images to guide the designer.</li>



<li>Ensuring that the design aligns with the brand&#8217;s visual identity: The graphic designer must create designs that align with the brand&#8217;s visual identity to ensure that the images or graphics support the overall messaging and aesthetic of the blog and the company. This may require adhering to specific branding guidelines or working with the company&#8217;s design team to ensure that the designs are consistent with the brand&#8217;s aesthetic.</li>



<li>Managing the design process and timelines: It can be challenging to manage the design process and ensure that the final designs are delivered on time. This may require setting clear deadlines and expectations, providing timely feedback and revisions, and communicating regularly with the designer to ensure that the project stays on track.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to make designing images or graphics for your marketing content, faster and cheaper?</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/d4836961-deee-426c-b811-cb1d8408b629-33129-000013379ee66ce0_file-1024x601.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-935"/></figure>



<p>To make designing images or graphics for marketing content faster and cheaper, some possible strategies include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Using templates: Pre-made templates can save time and reduce the need for custom design work. This can be especially useful for common types of images or graphics, such as infographics or product photos.</li>



<li>Using stock images or graphics: Stock images or graphics can be a cost-effective way to access high-quality visuals without the need for custom design work. Many stock image or graphics libraries offer a wide range of options to choose from, and some even offer free or low-cost options.</li>



<li>Creating a library of reusable graphics: By creating a library of reusable graphics, such as logos, icons, or banners, a company can save time and resources by reusing these elements in different marketing materials. This can help to ensure consistency and reduce the need for custom design work for each new marketing project.</li>



<li>Automating image or graphic creation: Some tools and software can automate the creation of images or graphics, such as using AI or data visualization algorithms to generate custom designs. This can save time and reduce the need for manual design work.</li>



<li>Outsourcing design work: Hiring a professional designer or agency to create the images or graphics can save time and resources, especially for complex or specialized designs. This can also ensure that the designs are of high quality and align with the brand&#8217;s visual identity.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges in organizing, categorizing, and searching a reusable library of graphics and images</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1fbf522f-476f-4004-8e40-8cc654243b4b-33129-000013382c533b7d_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-936"/></figure>



<p>Some challenges that may arise when organizing, categorizing, and searching a reusable library of graphics and images include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Determining the appropriate categories and tags: It can be difficult to determine the most effective system of categories and tags for organizing the library. This may require conducting user research or testing different systems to determine the best approach.</li>



<li>Ensuring that the images and graphics are properly labeled: The images and graphics in the library must be properly labeled to make them easy to find and access. This may require creating standardized labels or guidelines for labeling the visuals, and ensuring that all images and graphics are properly labeled.</li>



<li>Managing the library: The library must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains organized, accessible, and useful. This may require dedicated resources to manage the library and keep it updated, as well as regular review and evaluation of the images and graphics to ensure that they remain relevant and useful.</li>



<li>Searching the library: It can be challenging to find the appropriate images or graphics in the library, especially if the search query is vague or the library is large and complex. This may require implementing advanced search capabilities, such as keyword matching or image recognition, to make it easier for users to find the visuals they need.l</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How AI can revolutionize creating a reusable library of images and graphics </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/01f7e853-b575-42ba-ab65-8a1f3e1ee9af-33129-000013387efdcaef_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-937"/></figure>



<p>AI technology has the potential to revolutionize the process of creating a reusable library of images and graphics by enabling the automation of many tasks and making it easier to manage and search the library. Some possible ways that AI can be used in this context include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Automating the categorization and labeling of images and graphics: AI algorithms can be used to automatically categorize and label images and graphics based on their content, making it easier to organize the library and find the appropriate visuals.</li>



<li>Generating custom images and graphics: AI algorithms can be used to generate custom images and graphics based on specific input, such as data or text. This can save time and resources by reducing the need for manual design work.</li>



<li>Enabling advanced search capabilities: AI algorithms can be used to enable advanced search capabilities, such as keyword matching or image recognition, to make it easier for users to find the appropriate visuals in the library.</li>



<li>Identifying duplicates and similar images and graphics: AI algorithms can be used to identify duplicates or similar images and graphics in the library, making it easier to manage the library and avoid redundancy.</li>



<li>Analyzing usage and performance data: AI algorithms can be used to analyze usage and performance data for the images and graphics in the library, providing insights into which visuals are most popular or effective. This can help to inform future updates and improvements to the library.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>



<p>So to conclude that you can save tons of time by enabling a much powerful search on your previously created media content using AI that can understand the visual concepts in your images and graphics, this making it easy to retrieve and reuse media.</p>

<p>Running a startup on a bootstrap budget is about focus, because you do not have resources to dedicate on things that are not important. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image_3afe62-42 size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DALL·E-2022-10-31-15.18.20-a-startup-founder-struggling-to-run-his-company-on-a-tight-budget-and-without-any-funding-digital-art.png" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-778" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But, how can startups achieve focus? </h2>



<p>One critical way to achieve focus is measurement. I think it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re running a small company that you establish what you are trying to accomplish, what&#8217;s your intended outcome? </p>



<p>For example, say that startup is about, issuing documents. Documents that would ultimately be shared by the recipient. For example, let&#8217;s say your company is a platform that issues digital credentials (like certificates, and badges), and ultimately received by people and they share them on their social media handles like WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. </p>



<p>So, for a company like this, first ask yourself a question like</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What is my intended outcome? What do I want to achieve? </p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/30fa0f26-f9a6-4760-92d4-0b2b65deda92-31072-0000052ba3c4a245_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-773"/></figure></div>


<p>The answer here is that I want to increase the number of shares, documents that are shared and I want to increase the number of use of those documents. Now next question, you ask is </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What are the various steps in the process when it comes to achieving the intended outcome? </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The steps in the process are, for example going to number of documents that are actually issued using your platform, the number of documents that are received, sent, the number of documents that are opened, and then the number of documents that are shared. </p>



<p>So the idea here is that measure each step in the in the process of achieving the outcome that you are trying to achieve and try to ensure that people are held accountable. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0fd72e47-5b28-493d-9d5e-7e6c098b4f55-31072-00000529e0068ea6_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-772"/></figure></div>


<p>So identify individuals in your organization who are held accountable for each of those metrics. In the start of a company a bootstrapped one, with very few people, it might be that you are responsible for multiple metrics down the funnel. </p>



<p>But in a slightly bigger organization, you will have individuals accountable for these steps, for example, marketing would be responsible for increasing the number of documents issued and customer support might be, responsible for getting a document opened. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>On a daily basis, you should review what your performance goal is and keep on every day, stare at the value creation objective for your end users. In my next post I will be discussing how a bootstrapped startup can do marketing on a tight budget, so stay tuned or subscribe.</p>
