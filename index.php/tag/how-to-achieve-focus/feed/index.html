<p>This is a common problem that people face in finding their passion or purpose. I am going to talk about an easy two-step process to find your passion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: identify what you are naturally good at.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/d0d712e6-66e1-4304-8be8-392369d42a98-38697-00001702d135c5f3_file-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-897"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Steve Jobs was naturally good at making things simple. Elon Musk is naturally good at being an engineer. </p>



<p>Please note that while answering this question for yourself the answer can’t be that “I am naturally good at baseball, basketball, etc”. If that is where your answer is going then look deeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>But how do you find what you are naturally good at?</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.1: Simply observe what you spend time doing. </h4>



<p>Write daily in detail about things that you are spending time on. For instance, I wrote yesterday “spent time comparing stocks and their PE ratio”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/12a497f6-797d-4ed8-822a-03d4fe83157c-38697-000017049634ab52_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-899"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Then over say a month, when you analyze you will see both what you are naturally good at and the challenges in those areas. </p>



<p>For me the analysis was I spend time meditating, writing blog posts, sculpting my body, web product development, etc.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.2: Look deeper</h4>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/59b8f405-191b-4eda-a01a-1808f4b2c4fa-38697-00001788f3a27a65_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-902"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Pick each area and note the why? </p>



<p>For example, say you are naturally good at cooking but the underlying skill will be that you are naturally good at figuring out how things are going to combine and what results they create.</p>



<p>For me. The why for Mediation was? I am inclined towards the search for a calmer mind. Why Web product development? means that I like making complex things simple and the nature of products I build are complex and difficult so I need engineering challenges as well.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: not all areas you spend time on are your passions if they won&#8217;t have a good “Why”. People are forced into some jobs and activities but you can look at what aspect of that work you excel at.</p>



<p>Often your friends and colleagues are a good source to ask what they think makes you unique.</p>



<p>By now you should have found what you are naturally good at and also what your passions are. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Find areas that need your natural skill, and passion.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bdd36f67-cf3a-4a3d-8957-eb9d48ad92c6-38697-0000178a517f703f_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-903"/></figure></div>


<p>Phones, laptops, and music players are complex, so Steve Jobs chose that market to apply his natural skill of making things simple.</p>



<p>Electric cars, solar panels, and rockets require a lot of engineering so Elon Musk chose that market to apply his natural skills and love of engineering.</p>



<p>In my case, I am naturally good at making complex things simple. Stock research and analyzing a company is very complex, I plan to apply my skills to make this complex process simpler.</p>



<p>At this point your detailed observations will tell you the unsolved problems in the area you picked. For me, it was no easy way to compare stocks, and too much information, and opinions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ef38af96-53a0-4647-930b-9810d7368ae4-38697-0000178b2e1c07d5_file-300x225.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-904"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>To conclude, to find your passion, discover what you are naturally good at by observing what you do each day. Then try to find which market needs your skills the most. And then just commit yourself to solving problems in that market by doing what you are naturally good at.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>By the way, this is called finding product founder market fit.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In my next post, I am going to give practical advice on how to innovate in the area you committed to devote your next 10 years to, stay tuned …</p>

<p>Running a startup on a bootstrap budget is about focus, because you do not have resources to dedicate on things that are not important. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image_3afe62-42 size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DALL·E-2022-10-31-15.18.20-a-startup-founder-struggling-to-run-his-company-on-a-tight-budget-and-without-any-funding-digital-art.png" alt="" class="kb-img wp-image-778" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But, how can startups achieve focus? </h2>



<p>One critical way to achieve focus is measurement. I think it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re running a small company that you establish what you are trying to accomplish, what&#8217;s your intended outcome? </p>



<p>For example, say that startup is about, issuing documents. Documents that would ultimately be shared by the recipient. For example, let&#8217;s say your company is a platform that issues digital credentials (like certificates, and badges), and ultimately received by people and they share them on their social media handles like WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. </p>



<p>So, for a company like this, first ask yourself a question like</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What is my intended outcome? What do I want to achieve? </p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/30fa0f26-f9a6-4760-92d4-0b2b65deda92-31072-0000052ba3c4a245_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-773"/></figure></div>


<p>The answer here is that I want to increase the number of shares, documents that are shared and I want to increase the number of use of those documents. Now next question, you ask is </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What are the various steps in the process when it comes to achieving the intended outcome? </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The steps in the process are, for example going to number of documents that are actually issued using your platform, the number of documents that are received, sent, the number of documents that are opened, and then the number of documents that are shared. </p>



<p>So the idea here is that measure each step in the in the process of achieving the outcome that you are trying to achieve and try to ensure that people are held accountable. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0fd72e47-5b28-493d-9d5e-7e6c098b4f55-31072-00000529e0068ea6_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-772"/></figure></div>


<p>So identify individuals in your organization who are held accountable for each of those metrics. In the start of a company a bootstrapped one, with very few people, it might be that you are responsible for multiple metrics down the funnel. </p>



<p>But in a slightly bigger organization, you will have individuals accountable for these steps, for example, marketing would be responsible for increasing the number of documents issued and customer support might be, responsible for getting a document opened. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>On a daily basis, you should review what your performance goal is and keep on every day, stare at the value creation objective for your end users. In my next post I will be discussing how a bootstrapped startup can do marketing on a tight budget, so stay tuned or subscribe.</p>
