This may require creating standardized labels or guidelines for labeling the visuals, and ensuring that all images and graphics are properly labeled.</li>



<li>Managing the library: The library must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains organized, accessible, and useful. This may require dedicated resources to manage the library and keep it updated, as well as regular review and evaluation of the images and graphics to ensure that they remain relevant and useful.</li>



<li>Searching the library: It can be challenging to find the appropriate images or graphics in the library, especially if the search query is vague or the library is large and complex.

<ol>
<li>Automating the categorization and labeling of images and graphics: AI algorithms can be used to automatically categorize and label images and graphics based on their content, making it easier to organize the library and find the appropriate visuals.</li>



<li>Generating custom images and graphics: AI algorithms can be used to generate custom images and graphics based on specific input, such as data or text. This can save time and resources by reducing the need for manual design work.</li>



<li>Enabling advanced search capabilities: AI algorithms can be used to enable advanced search capabilities, such as keyword matching or image recognition, to make it easier for users to find the appropriate visuals in the library.</li>



<li>Identifying duplicates and similar images and graphics: AI algorithms can be used to identify duplicates or similar images and graphics in the library, making it easier to manage the library and avoid redundancy.</li>
