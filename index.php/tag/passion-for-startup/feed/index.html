<p>This is a common problem that people face in finding their passion or purpose. I am going to talk about an easy two-step process to find your passion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: identify what you are naturally good at.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/d0d712e6-66e1-4304-8be8-392369d42a98-38697-00001702d135c5f3_file-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-897"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Steve Jobs was naturally good at making things simple. Elon Musk is naturally good at being an engineer. </p>



<p>Please note that while answering this question for yourself the answer can’t be that “I am naturally good at baseball, basketball, etc”. If that is where your answer is going then look deeper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>But how do you find what you are naturally good at?</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.1: Simply observe what you spend time doing. </h4>



<p>Write daily in detail about things that you are spending time on. For instance, I wrote yesterday “spent time comparing stocks and their PE ratio”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/12a497f6-797d-4ed8-822a-03d4fe83157c-38697-000017049634ab52_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-899"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Then over say a month, when you analyze you will see both what you are naturally good at and the challenges in those areas. </p>



<p>For me the analysis was I spend time meditating, writing blog posts, sculpting my body, web product development, etc.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.2: Look deeper</h4>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/59b8f405-191b-4eda-a01a-1808f4b2c4fa-38697-00001788f3a27a65_file-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-902"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Pick each area and note the why? </p>



<p>For example, say you are naturally good at cooking but the underlying skill will be that you are naturally good at figuring out how things are going to combine and what results they create.</p>



<p>For me. The why for Mediation was? I am inclined towards the search for a calmer mind. Why Web product development? means that I like making complex things simple and the nature of products I build are complex and difficult so I need engineering challenges as well.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: not all areas you spend time on are your passions if they won&#8217;t have a good “Why”. People are forced into some jobs and activities but you can look at what aspect of that work you excel at.</p>



<p>Often your friends and colleagues are a good source to ask what they think makes you unique.</p>



<p>By now you should have found what you are naturally good at and also what your passions are. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Find areas that need your natural skill, and passion.</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bdd36f67-cf3a-4a3d-8957-eb9d48ad92c6-38697-0000178a517f703f_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-903"/></figure></div>


<p>Phones, laptops, and music players are complex, so Steve Jobs chose that market to apply his natural skill of making things simple.</p>



<p>Electric cars, solar panels, and rockets require a lot of engineering so Elon Musk chose that market to apply his natural skills and love of engineering.</p>



<p>In my case, I am naturally good at making complex things simple. Stock research and analyzing a company is very complex, I plan to apply my skills to make this complex process simpler.</p>



<p>At this point your detailed observations will tell you the unsolved problems in the area you picked. For me, it was no easy way to compare stocks, and too much information, and opinions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ef38af96-53a0-4647-930b-9810d7368ae4-38697-0000178b2e1c07d5_file-300x225.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-904"/></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>To conclude, to find your passion, discover what you are naturally good at by observing what you do each day. Then try to find which market needs your skills the most. And then just commit yourself to solving problems in that market by doing what you are naturally good at.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>By the way, this is called finding product founder market fit.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In my next post, I am going to give practical advice on how to innovate in the area you committed to devote your next 10 years to, stay tuned …</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to come up with startup ideas: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1692.png" alt="" class="wp-image-759"/></figure>



<p>1. Look at what&#8217;s already out there and find a way to improve it </p>



<p>2. Solve a problem that you or someone you know is experiencing </p>



<p>This is the common advice. The problem I find is that this approach gives you too many ideas. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can you find ideas that you have passion for?</h2>



<p></p>



<p>So one secret to finding ideas that you have a passion for is to focus on things that you do daily. </p>



<p>For example, If you spend a lot of time say in investment just observe, what are the things that you feel like doing and you&#8217;re not able to do? What do you spend more time doing? </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1693-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-762 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;re spending a lot of time or effort in figuring out comparing a stock or reading the transcript report, just observe, figure out what while reading the transcript, what are you trying to get out of it and see if you can fundamentally come up or use a disruptive technology to to eliminate that.</p>
</div></div>



<p>See, there is always a market so you want to look at current market for a product like this would be that somebody would pay for. In this case, let&#8217;s say a financial analyst is going through these talks and identifying what exactly is the transcript earning calls transcript is saying, What if you could develop technology that could do the same? What if it is not just technology, what if you could, connect people to other people who can potentially help you accomplish this and make them do things for each other so that it&#8217;s gets the same job done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>To conclude, a quick tip, when the day ends, or maybe the start of the day, just simply write all your observations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1694.png" alt="" class="wp-image-765"/></figure>



<p>Write what you saw, what you spent more time on, resist the temptation to get ideas or judge your observations. Resist the temptation to come up the solution to the problem, Just take note of the emotion. Notice what is happening. Soon you will discover a theme emerging, an opportunity will emerge.</p>



<p>Good news is that this opportunity will be something you have passion towards. In my next blog I will cover what other things to ensure when you are evaluating this opportunity, so stay tuned.</p>
