<p>Running a startup on a bootstrap budget is about focus, because you do not have resources to dedicate on things that are not important. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But, how can startups achieve focus? </h2>



<p>One critical way to achieve focus is measurement. I think it&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re running a small company that you establish what you are trying to accomplish, what&#8217;s your intended outcome? </p>



<p>For example, say that startup is about, issuing documents. Documents that would ultimately be shared by the recipient. For example, let&#8217;s say your company is a platform that issues digital credentials (like certificates, and badges), and ultimately received by people and they share them on their social media handles like WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. </p>



<p>So, for a company like this, first ask yourself a question like</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What is my intended outcome? What do I want to achieve? </p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/30fa0f26-f9a6-4760-92d4-0b2b65deda92-31072-0000052ba3c4a245_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-773"/></figure></div>


<p>The answer here is that I want to increase the number of shares, documents that are shared and I want to increase the number of use of those documents. Now next question, you ask is </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What are the various steps in the process when it comes to achieving the intended outcome? </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The steps in the process are, for example going to number of documents that are actually issued using your platform, the number of documents that are received, sent, the number of documents that are opened, and then the number of documents that are shared. </p>



<p>So the idea here is that measure each step in the in the process of achieving the outcome that you are trying to achieve and try to ensure that people are held accountable. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0fd72e47-5b28-493d-9d5e-7e6c098b4f55-31072-00000529e0068ea6_file-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-772"/></figure></div>


<p>So identify individuals in your organization who are held accountable for each of those metrics. In the start of a company a bootstrapped one, with very few people, it might be that you are responsible for multiple metrics down the funnel. </p>



<p>But in a slightly bigger organization, you will have individuals accountable for these steps, for example, marketing would be responsible for increasing the number of documents issued and customer support might be, responsible for getting a document opened. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>On a daily basis, you should review what your performance goal is and keep on every day, stare at the value creation objective for your end users. In my next post I will be discussing how a bootstrapped startup can do marketing on a tight budget, so stay tuned or subscribe.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to come up with startup ideas: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1692.png" alt="" class="wp-image-759"/></figure>



<p>1. Look at what&#8217;s already out there and find a way to improve it </p>



<p>2. Solve a problem that you or someone you know is experiencing </p>



<p>This is the common advice. The problem I find is that this approach gives you too many ideas. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can you find ideas that you have passion for?</h2>



<p></p>



<p>So one secret to finding ideas that you have a passion for is to focus on things that you do daily. </p>



<p>For example, If you spend a lot of time say in investment just observe, what are the things that you feel like doing and you&#8217;re not able to do? What do you spend more time doing? </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1693-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-762 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;re spending a lot of time or effort in figuring out comparing a stock or reading the transcript report, just observe, figure out what while reading the transcript, what are you trying to get out of it and see if you can fundamentally come up or use a disruptive technology to to eliminate that.</p>
</div></div>



<p>See, there is always a market so you want to look at current market for a product like this would be that somebody would pay for. In this case, let&#8217;s say a financial analyst is going through these talks and identifying what exactly is the transcript earning calls transcript is saying, What if you could develop technology that could do the same? What if it is not just technology, what if you could, connect people to other people who can potentially help you accomplish this and make them do things for each other so that it&#8217;s gets the same job done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>To conclude, a quick tip, when the day ends, or maybe the start of the day, just simply write all your observations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/img_1694.png" alt="" class="wp-image-765"/></figure>



<p>Write what you saw, what you spent more time on, resist the temptation to get ideas or judge your observations. Resist the temptation to come up the solution to the problem, Just take note of the emotion. Notice what is happening. Soon you will discover a theme emerging, an opportunity will emerge.</p>



<p>Good news is that this opportunity will be something you have passion towards. In my next blog I will cover what other things to ensure when you are evaluating this opportunity, so stay tuned.</p>
