This allows you to determine if the prospect is a good fit for your product or service and if they have the potential to become a customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualifying a lead typically involves gathering information about their needs, budget, timeline, and decision-making process. Once you have this information, you can use it to determine whether your product or service is a good fit for their needs and whether it&#8217;s worth investing time and resources in a demo or pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the prospect meets your criteria and appears to be a good fit, then you can proceed with a product demo or pitch. This will give you the opportunity to showcase the benefits and features of your product or service and explain how it can meet the prospect&#8217;s needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the prospect doesn&#8217;t meet your criteria or appears to be a poor fit for your product or service, then it may be best to move on and focus your efforts on other leads who are more likely to become customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating a difficult \/ arrogant prospect<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some phrases you can use to encourage the prospect to share more information and engage in a conversation about their needs, even when they are focused on seeing a demo:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;Before we jump into the demo, I&#8217;d love to hear more about your current situation and what you&#8217;re hoping to achieve with our product. Can you tell me a bit more about that?&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;I completely understand you&#8217;re excited to see our product, but understanding your needs will help us customize the demo to your specific situation. Can you share some more information about your company&#8217;s goals?&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to give you a demo that&#8217;s tailored to your specific needs. Can you tell me more about your current workflow and what challenges you&#8217;re currently facing?&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;We can definitely show you how our product works, but it would be really helpful to understand more about your company and what you&#8217;re looking for. Can you share some details about your current process and pain points?&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to give you a demo, but before we get started, could you give me some more context about your role and how our product would fit into your workflow?&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;I want to make sure our demo is as useful as possible for you. Can you give me some more information about your decision-making process and what criteria you&#8217;re using to evaluate solutions like ours?&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re interested in our product, but to make sure it&#8217;s the right fit for you, I&#8217;d love to hear more about your business and the challenges you&#8217;re facing. Can you share some more information about that?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the lead qualification happen before or after the discovery call?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During a discovery call, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to learn more about the lead&#8217;s needs and how your product or service can help solve their problems. However, if the lead doesn&#8217;t meet your qualification criteria, it may not be worth investing the time and resources into a discovery call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By qualifying leads before the discovery call, you can ensure that you&#8217;re focusing your efforts on those who are more likely to become customers, and that you&#8217;re not wasting time on leads that aren&#8217;t a good fit for your product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a cold lead asks why you&#8217;re calling and what you have to offer, it&#8217;s important to start by providing a brief introduction and explanation of what your company does, but also to quickly pivot to asking some qualifying questions. Here&#8217;s an example of how you could respond:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I&#8217;m calling from [Your Company]. We specialize in [Your Product\/Service] and I wanted to see if you might be interested in learning more. But before I jump into details, could you tell me a bit more about your current process and the challenges you&#8217;re facing in your industry? This will help me better understand if we might be a good fit for your needs.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By starting with a brief introduction and explanation of what your company does, you acknowledge the reason for your call and help the prospect understand why you&#8217;re reaching out. However, by quickly pivoting to asking some qualifying questions, you demonstrate that you&#8217;re interested in understanding their needs and challenges, rather than just pitching your product\/service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cold calling rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3&#215;3 Rule by Trish Bertuzzi: Trish Bertuzzi, author of &#8220;The Sales Development Playbook,&#8221; recommends the 3&#215;3 rule for cold calling. This involves making three calls to the same prospect over three days, leaving a different voicemail message each time. The first message is an introduction and a reason for calling, the second is a reminder of the first message and a new value proposition, and the third is a final reminder and a call-to-action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Hook, Line, and Sinker&#8221; Method by John Barrows: John Barrows, sales trainer and consultant, recommends the &#8220;hook, line, and sinker&#8221; method for cold calling. The hook is a strong opening statement that grabs the prospect&#8217;s attention, the line is a brief explanation of what you do and why you&#8217;re calling, and the sinker is a question that engages the prospect in a conversation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are some cold calling tips shared by sales experts in their interviews:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal of the first call should not be to sell, but to get the prospect to engage in a conversation with you.&#8221; &#8211; Jeb Blount<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Before you make a cold call, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target market and your ideal customer profile.&#8221; &#8211; Jill Konrath<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Be confident and enthusiastic when making your cold call. People can hear your smile through the phone.&#8221; &#8211; John Barrows<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The paradox<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental challenge you have to solve is that lead or prospect wants to know what I have to offer, the demo, etc, and on the other hand you want to ask him questions, engage him in conversations, qualify, etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to deal with this paradox?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to resolving this paradox is to balance the prospect&#8217;s desire to learn about your product or service with your need to gather information and qualify them as a potential customer. Here are a few strategies that can help:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that interest and let them know that you understand why they&#8217;re curious. You might say something like, &#8220;I appreciate your enthusiasm for our product, and I&#8217;d be happy to show you how it works. But before we dive into the demo, I&#8217;d like to ask you a few questions to make sure that it&#8217;s a good fit for your needs.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide a high-level overview: Instead of launching directly into a full product demo, you might consider giving the prospect a brief overview of what your product or service does and how it can benefit them. This can help establish context and give them a sense of why they should be interested, without overwhelming them with too much information too quickly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ask open-ended questions: One way to engage the prospect in conversation and gather information is to ask open-ended questions that encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings. For example, you might ask, &#8220;Can you tell me more about your current process for [specific task]?&#8221; or &#8220;What are some of the biggest challenges you&#8217;ve faced in [specific area]?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are some examples of how sales experts have given a high-level overview and then pivoted to asking questions:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I help businesses like yours improve their workflow and productivity.
