<p>This article, inspired by <a href="https://www.ihwcouncil.org/profile/dr-sanjiv-kumar/">Dr. Sanjiv Kumar&#8217;s</a> course on <a href="https://mu.linkedin.com/posts/dr-sanjiv-kumar-a5272417_agenda-leadership-course-activity-7050876295391379456-lLGk">Public Health Leadership</a>, delves into the intricacies of leadership within different types of organizations. It aims to address a common pain point in today&#8217;s professional landscape: many individuals spend a significant portion of their lives working in jobs that they dislike or find unfulfilling. Surprisingly, only a fraction of them take the time to perform a personal self-assessment to determine if they are a natural fit for the organization they are working in.</p>



<p>Statistics reveal that job dissatisfaction is pervasive across various industries. According to a <a href="https://haiilo.com/blog/employee-engagement-8-statistics-you-need-to-know/">Gallup survey, a staggering 85% of employees</a> worldwide are disengaged or actively disengaged at work. Another study by the Conference Board found that only 45% of U.S. workers are satisfied with their jobs. These figures highlight the need for individuals to reflect on their own preferences, strengths, and aspirations when considering their career paths.</p>



<p>This article aims to bridge that gap by comparing different organization types and providing a guide to help individuals assess which type may be the best fit for their personality, values, and career goals. By understanding the unique characteristics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_business">family-run companies</a>, <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/multinational-corporation/">professional large multinational corporations (MNCs)</a>, startups, the military, and government organizations, individuals can gain insights into the leadership styles, structures, and cultures of each type.</p>

<p>The intention is not to prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their professional journeys. By undertaking a personal self-assessment and considering the attributes of different organization types, individuals can better align their skills, aspirations, and work preferences with their chosen organizational environment.</p>



<p>Through the comparison of organization types and the provision of a self-assessment guide, this article aims to assist individuals in identifying the organization type that best suits their personality and professional goals. By addressing the pain point of job dissatisfaction and encouraging self-reflection, we hope to guide individuals towards a more fulfilling and harmonious career path, where they can thrive and make a meaningful impact.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Matching Personality Types with Company Types: A Guide to Finding Your Perfect Fit</h4>



<p>In order to thrive and excel in their professional lives, individuals need to find an organizational environment that complements their personality traits, work preferences, and values. Understanding the relationship between personality types and different company types can be instrumental in identifying the ideal organizational fit. In this section, we present a guide that correlates various personality types with different company types, providing valuable insights into the compatibility between individuals and their work environments. By assessing their own personalities and considering the characteristics of each company type, individuals can make informed decisions that maximize their potential for success, job satisfaction, and long-term fulfillment.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a table that helps individuals assess which company or organization type might be best for them based on their personality type:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Personality Type</th><th>Family-Run Company</th><th>Professional Large MNC</th><th>Startup</th><th>Army</th><th>Government</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Independent and entrepreneurial</td><td>Limited decision-making autonomy</td><td>Potential for limited creativity and innovation</td><td>High level of autonomy and freedom to experiment</td><td>Moderate level of autonomy, depending on rank</td><td>Moderate level of autonomy, depending on role</td></tr><tr><td>Collaborative and team-oriented</td><td>Strong sense of belonging and family-like environment</td><td>Opportunities for cross-functional collaboration</td><td>Emphasis on teamwork and collective efforts</td><td>Strong sense of camaraderie and teamwork</td><td>Opportunities for collaboration with diverse stakeholders</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-tolerant and adaptive</td><td>Limited exposure to risk and slower adaptation to change</td><td>Opportunities for calculated risk-taking and adaptability</td><td>High risk-reward ratio and willingness to embrace uncertainty</td><td>Moderate level of risk-taking, focused on mission objectives</td><td>Moderate level of risk-taking, dependent on specific government policies</td></tr><tr><td>Result-driven and competitive</td><td>Potential limitations in attracting and retaining top talent</td><td>Opportunities for career growth and recognition</td><td>Opportunities for rapid growth and potential for equity ownership</td><td>Focus on performance and mission accomplishment</td><td>Opportunities for impact and influence on public policies</td></tr><tr><td>Stability and job security</td><td>Potential reliance on personal relationships and job security</td><td>Stable and established work environment</td><td>Potential for high growth and reward, but with higher uncertainty</td><td>Job security and stable career progression</td><td>Potential for job security and stability</td></tr><tr><td>Creativity and innovation</td><td>Potential limitations in adopting change and innovation</td><td>Opportunities for innovation within established processes</td><td>Opportunities for disruptive thinking and innovation</td><td>Limited scope for individual innovation, but opportunity for teamwork</td><td>Potential for innovation in policy development and public service</td></tr><tr><td>Work-life balance and flexibility</td><td>Potential flexibility in work arrangements</td><td>Varied work-life balance based on job role</td><td>Potential for flexible work arrangements and autonomy</td><td>Structured work-life balance and routines</td><td>Structured work-life balance and adherence to protocols</td></tr><tr><td>Leadership and decision-making</td><td>Potential influence of family members in decision-making</td><td>Opportunities for leadership roles based on merit and performance</td><td>Opportunities for entrepreneurial leadership and decision-making</td><td>Clear hierarchical leadership structure</td><td>Opportunities for leadership in public service and policy-making</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>table that includes a scoring mechanism where individuals can multiply their self-assigned scores for each personality type by the corresponding scores for each organization type. They can then sum up the multiplied scores to find the organization type with the highest total score:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Personality Type</th><th>Family-Run Company</th><th>Professional Large MNC</th><th>Startup</th><th>Army</th><th>Government</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Independent and entrepreneurial</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Collaborative and team-oriented</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-tolerant and adaptive</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Result-driven and competitive</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Stability and job security</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Creativity and innovation</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Work-life balance and flexibility</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Leadership and decision-making</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To determine the best organizational fit, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Score yourself on each personality type based on your own preferences and characteristics, ranging from 1 (low fit) to 5 (high fit).</li>



<li>Multiply your self-assigned scores for each personality type by the corresponding scores for each organization type.</li>



<li>Sum up the multiplied scores for each organization type.</li>



<li>The organization type with the highest total score is likely to be the best fit for you based on your personality traits and preferences.</li>
</ol>



<p>For example, if you scored yourself 4 for &#8220;Independent and entrepreneurial&#8221; personality type, you would multiply it by the corresponding scores for each organization type (Family-Run &#8220;Lala&#8221; Company: 2, Professional Large MNC: 3, Startup: 4, Army: 3, Government: 2). Repeat this process for each personality type and organization type, and then sum up the multiplied scores to find the highest total score.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Leadership Styles and their relationship to Organization Types</h4>



<p>It is also important to asses which leadership style is a great fit for which company type. First, it can help you asses that the company you are a part of is under the right leadership, and second you can asses if you can rise to the right level of leadership based on your personal preference</p>



<ol>
<li>Autocratic: Autocratic leaders make decisions independently and enforce them without much input from others. They have centralized authority and control over the decision-making process, often resulting in a top-down approach. This style can be effective in situations that require quick decision-making or in highly structured environments like the military.</li>



<li>Democratic: Democratic leaders involve team members in the decision-making process, seeking their input and considering their perspectives. They encourage collaboration, participation, and open communication. This style promotes a sense of ownership among team members and fosters a positive work environment.</li>



<li>Laissez-Faire: Laissez-faire leaders adopt a hands-off approach, allowing employees to make decisions and work independently with minimal supervision. They provide freedom and autonomy to their team members, trusting them to take ownership of their tasks and make their own choices. This style can be effective in creative and innovative environments, such as startups.</li>



<li>Transformational: Transformational leaders inspire and motivate their teams through a compelling vision and a focus on personal development. They encourage creativity, challenge the status quo, and empower individuals to reach their full potential. This style fosters a positive and high-performance work culture.</li>



<li>Transactional: Transactional leaders focus on setting clear expectations, providing rewards, and enforcing consequences based on performance. They establish a clear framework of tasks, goals, and rewards, emphasizing the exchange between leaders and followers. This style is often seen in professional MNCs with well-defined hierarchies.</li>



<li>Servant: Servant leaders prioritize the needs and growth of their team members. They serve others by supporting their development, providing guidance, and removing obstacles. This style promotes a sense of collaboration, empathy, and a focus on the well-being of employees.</li>



<li>Charismatic: Charismatic leaders possess strong personal charisma and influence. They inspire and motivate others through their compelling vision, persuasive communication, and magnetic personality. This style can be influential in startups or organizations with a strong emphasis on entrepreneurship.</li>



<li>Situational/Adaptive: Situational or adaptive leaders are flexible and adjust their leadership style based on the needs of the situation and the capabilities of their team members. They assess the situation, consider the strengths and weaknesses of their team, and adapt their approach accordingly to maximize effectiveness.</li>
</ol>



<p>Remember that leadership styles are not mutually exclusive, and effective leaders often blend multiple styles based on the context and the individuals they lead. The key is to be adaptable and employ the most appropriate style for the given circumstances and organizational culture.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Leadership Style</th><th>Family-Run &#8220;Lala&#8221; Company</th><th>Professional Large MNC</th><th>Startup</th><th>Army</th><th>Government</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Autocratic</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Democratic</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Laissez-Faire</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Transformational</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Transactional</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Servant</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Charismatic</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Situational/Adaptive</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Note: The table above provides a general perspective on which leadership styles tend to suit different company types. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that leadership styles can vary even within the same company type, and there can be exceptions to the general tendencies mentioned here. Additionally, effective leadership requires a combination of various styles, adaptability, and alignment with the organization&#8217;s values, culture, and goals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>



<p>As we conclude, it is important to acknowledge that leadership is a continuous learning process. Dr. Kumar&#8217;s course has imparted valuable leadership lessons, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, effective communication, and the ability to inspire and motivate others. These lessons transcend organizational boundaries and can be applied in any leadership role.</p>



<p>Finding the right organizational fit is vital for long-term job satisfaction and personal fulfillment. By exploring different company types and their characteristics, we have provided insights into leadership styles, work environments, communication styles, and conflict resolution approaches. Our guide and scoring mechanism offer a practical tool for individuals to assess their compatibility with various company types based on their personality traits.</p>

<p>Inspired by an insightful talk delivered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-jain-1591752/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fcode.exmyb.com%2F">Amit Jain, Chairman &amp; MD India, L&#8217;Oreal</a>, at the <a href="https://code.exmyb.com/">CODE summit</a> in Delhi, I felt compelled to share the strategies and secrets that enable startups to achieve remarkable branding success despite limited resources. In a world dominated by renowned brands like Coca-Cola, Nike, and L&#8217;Oreal, startups and indie hackers often find themselves facing a significant challenge: how to achieve a strong brand presence with limited budgets and resources. However, with the right approach and innovative strategies, these underdogs can still make a significant impact. In this article, we will explore how startups can leverage emotional differentiation and cultural differentiation to establish their brands and connect with their target audience, ultimately leading to long-term success.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Emotional Differentiation: Connecting on a Deeper Level:</h4>



<p>One of the most powerful tools in a startup&#8217;s branding arsenal is emotional differentiation. While larger companies may have extensive budgets to create emotional connections, startups can achieve similar results through strategic storytelling, empathy, and authenticity. Here&#8217;s how they can do it:</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">a) Authentic Brand Storytelling: </h5>



<p>Startups can craft compelling narratives around their brand, focusing on their mission, values, and the problem they aim to solve. By sharing relatable stories and experiences, startups can create an emotional bond with their audience, driving loyalty and trust.</p>



<p>Example: Warby Parker, an online eyewear retailer, differentiated itself by sharing the story of its founders&#8217; frustration with the high cost of glasses. Their narrative emphasized affordable yet stylish eyewear, resonating with customers who were tired of overpriced options. This authentic brand story helped Warby Parker gain a dedicated following and disrupt the traditional eyewear industry.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How can your startup do Authentic Brand Storytelling?</h6>



<p>Step 1: Identify your mission and values: Start by defining the purpose and core values of your startup. Understand the problem you aim to solve and the impact you want to make in your customers&#8217; lives.</p>



<p>Step 2: Discover your unique story: Reflect on the journey that led to the creation of your startup. Uncover the personal experiences, challenges, or insights that inspired your venture. Find the narrative that resonates with your target audience.</p>



<p>Step 3: Craft compelling messaging: Develop a brand story that communicates your mission, values, and unique selling proposition. Connect emotionally with your audience by highlighting how your startup addresses their needs and aspirations.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">b) Empathetic Customer Understanding: </h5>



<p>By actively listening and empathizing with their customers, startups can gain valuable insights into their needs, desires, and pain points. This understanding allows them to tailor their messaging and product offerings to resonate with their target audience on an emotional level.</p>



<p>Example: Airbnb built a strong emotional connection with its customers by focusing on the concept of belonging. Through their &#8220;Belong Anywhere&#8221; campaign, Airbnb showcased heartwarming stories of travelers and hosts coming together, highlighting the emotional value of their platform beyond mere accommodations. This approach created a sense of community and trust, setting them apart from traditional hotel chains.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How can your startup do Empathetic Customer Understanding?</h6>



<p>Step 1: Conduct customer research: Engage with your target audience through surveys, interviews, or social media interactions. Seek to understand their pain points, desires, and motivations. Identify common themes and emotions associated with their experiences.</p>



<p>Step 2: Analyze customer feedback and data: Dive deep into customer feedback, reviews, and usage data. Look for patterns and insights that can help you understand the emotional aspects that drive their connection to your product or service.</p>



<p>Step 3: Tailor your messaging and product experience: Use the insights gained to refine your brand messaging and align it with the emotional needs and aspirations of your customers. Personalize your product experience to deliver moments that evoke positive emotions and create a lasting impact.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">c) Personalized Customer Experiences: </h5>



<p>Startups can create memorable and personalized experiences for their customers. By going the extra mile to show appreciation and deliver exceptional customer service, they can forge strong emotional connections that differentiate them from larger, impersonal corporations.</p>



<p>Example: Stitch Fix, an online personal styling service, uses data-driven algorithms and human stylists to create personalized clothing recommendations for each customer. By tailoring their offerings to individual preferences, Stitch Fix delivers a unique and personalized experience, generating a sense of loyalty and emotional connection.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How can you startup do Personalized Customer Experiences?</h6>



<p>Step 1: Develop a customer-centric approach: Put your customers at the center of your business strategy. Build systems and processes that prioritize exceptional customer service and create opportunities for personalization.</p>



<p>Step 2: Implement CRM tools and data analysis: Utilize customer relationship management (CRM) tools to gather and analyze data about your customers&#8217; preferences, purchase history, and interactions. Leverage this information to tailor your offerings and communications.</p>



<p>Step 3: Surprise and delight your customers: Go beyond expectations by offering personalized recommendations, exclusive deals, or handwritten notes. Show genuine appreciation for their support and foster a sense of connection that sets you apart from larger, impersonal corporations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural Differentiation: Establishing a Unique Brand Identity:</h4>



<p>Cultural differentiation plays a vital role in helping startups establish their brands and stand out in a crowded marketplace. Startups can tap into cultural nuances and values to resonate with their target audience. Here are some ways startups can leverage cultural differentiation:</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">a) Niche Marketing: </h5>



<p>Startups can focus on specific niche markets that align with their values, beliefs, and interests. By tailoring their brand messaging, products, and marketing efforts to cater to these niche segments, startups can position themselves as the go-to solution for a particular cultural community.</p>



<p>Example: Glossier, a skincare and beauty brand, gained a cult following by targeting a niche audience of millennials seeking a more natural and minimalist approach to beauty. Their inclusive brand messaging, minimalist packaging, and focus on skincare over heavy makeup helped them stand out in a crowded market, establishing Glossier as a cultural phenomenon.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">b) Collaborations and Partnerships: </h5>



<p>Startups can build alliances with influencers, content creators, or other brands that share their cultural values. These partnerships can help amplify their reach, build credibility, and create a unique brand identity that resonates with their target audience.</p>



<p>Example: Fenty Beauty, founded by Rihanna, disrupted the beauty industry by emphasizing inclusivity and diversity. Through collaborations with influencers and celebrities from various backgrounds, Fenty Beauty showcased a wide range of products suitable for different skin tones, setting a new standard for inclusivity in the beauty industry.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">c) Localization and Cultural Adaptation: </h5>



<p>Startups can adapt their products, services, and marketing strategies to the cultural nuances of different regions. By understanding the local customs, language, and preferences, startups can create a deeper connection with their target audience, establishing their brand as one that understands and respects local culture.</p>



<p>Example: Spotify localized its platform to cater to diverse music cultures worldwide. By curating playlists and featuring local artists, Spotify established a strong connection with users in different countries, showcasing an understanding and appreciation for their unique musical preferences and cultural identities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: </h4>



<p>Although startups and indie hackers may lack the financial resources and brand recognition of giant corporations, they possess unique advantages when it comes to branding. By leveraging emotional differentiation and cultural differentiation, startups can connect with their customers on a deeper level and establish a brand that resonates with their target audience. Through examples like Warby Parker, Airbnb, Glossier, and Spotify, we see that strategic storytelling, empathy, authenticity, cultural alignment, and personalized experiences can help startups achieve remarkable branding successes, laying the foundation for long-term growth and success.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to come up with startup ideas:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how_to_turn_your_start_up_ideas_into_a_business.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-570" width="817" height="457" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how_to_turn_your_start_up_ideas_into_a_business.jpg 408w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how_to_turn_your_start_up_ideas_into_a_business-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></figure>



<p>1. Look at what’s already out there and find a way to improve it</p>



<p>2. Solve a problem that you or someone you know is experiencing</p>



<p>This is the common advice. The problem I find is that this approach gives you too many ideas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can you find ideas that you have passion for?</h2>



<p>So one secret to finding ideas that you have a passion for is to focus on things that you do daily.</p>



<p>For example, If you spend a lot of time say in investment just observe, what are the things that you feel like doing and you’re not able to do? What do you spend more time doing?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aid1557372-v4-1200px-Sharpen-Your-Powers-of-Observation-Step-13-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-571" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aid1557372-v4-1200px-Sharpen-Your-Powers-of-Observation-Step-13-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aid1557372-v4-1200px-Sharpen-Your-Powers-of-Observation-Step-13-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aid1557372-v4-1200px-Sharpen-Your-Powers-of-Observation-Step-13-768x576.jpg 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aid1557372-v4-1200px-Sharpen-Your-Powers-of-Observation-Step-13.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Let’s say, for example, you’re spending a lot of time or effort in figuring out comparing a stock or reading the transcript report, just observe, figure out what while reading the transcript, what are you trying to get out of it and see if you can fundamentally come up or use a disruptive technology to to eliminate that.</p>



<p>See, there is always a market so you want to look at current market for a product like this would be that somebody would pay for. In this case, let’s say a financial analyst is going through these talks and identifying what exactly is the transcript earning calls transcript is saying, What if you could develop technology that could do the same? What if it is not just technology, what if you could, connect people to other people who can potentially help you accomplish this and make them do things for each other so that it’s gets the same job done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h2>



<p>To conclude, a quick tip, when the day ends, or maybe the start of the day, just simply write all your observations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="780" height="439" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stephanie-rimando-metro-vancouver-journal-writer.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-572" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stephanie-rimando-metro-vancouver-journal-writer.webp 780w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stephanie-rimando-metro-vancouver-journal-writer-300x169.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stephanie-rimando-metro-vancouver-journal-writer-768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></figure>



<p>Write what you saw, what you spent more time on, resist the temptation to get ideas or judge your observations. Resist the temptation to come up the solution to the problem, Just take note of the emotion. Notice what is happening. Soon you will discover a theme emerging, an opportunity will emerge.</p>



<p>Good news is that this opportunity will be something you have passion towards. In my next blog I will cover what other things to ensure when you are evaluating this opportunity, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Running a startup on a bootstrap budget is about focus, because you do not have resources to dedicate on things that are not important.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/960x0.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-567" width="819" height="546" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/960x0.webp 958w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/960x0-300x200.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/960x0-768x512.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/960x0-930x620.webp 930w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But, how can startups achieve focus?</h2>



<p>One critical way to achieve focus is measurement. I think it’s important if you’re running a small company that you establish what you are trying to accomplish, what’s your intended outcome?</p>



<p>For example, say that startup is about, issuing documents. Documents that would ultimately be shared by the recipient. For example, let’s say your company is a platform that issues digital credentials (like certificates, and badges), and ultimately received by people and they share them on their social media handles like WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</p>



<p>So, for a company like this, first ask yourself a question like</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What is my intended outcome? What do I want to achieve?</p>
</blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-6.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-566" width="819" height="327" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-6.jpeg 356w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-6-300x120.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></figure>



<p>The answer here is that I want to increase the number of shares, documents that are shared and I want to increase the number of use of those documents. Now next question, you ask is</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What are the various steps in the process when it comes to achieving the intended outcome?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The steps in the process are, for example going to number of documents that are actually issued using your platform, the number of documents that are received, sent, the number of documents that are opened, and then the number of documents that are shared.</p>



<p>So the idea here is that measure each step in the in the process of achieving the outcome that you are trying to achieve and try to ensure that people are held accountable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/What-is-a-KPI-1024x640.png" alt="" class="wp-image-565" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/What-is-a-KPI-1024x640.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/What-is-a-KPI-300x188.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/What-is-a-KPI-768x480.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/What-is-a-KPI.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>So identify individuals in your organization who are held accountable for each of those metrics. In the start of a company a bootstrapped one, with very few people, it might be that you are responsible for multiple metrics down the funnel.</p>



<p>But in a slightly bigger organization, you will have individuals accountable for these steps, for example, marketing would be responsible for increasing the number of documents issued and customer support might be, responsible for getting a document opened.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>On a daily basis, you should review what your performance goal is and keep on every day, stare at the value creation objective for your end users. In my next post I will be discussing how a bootstrapped startup can do marketing on a tight budget, so stay tuned or subscribe.</p>

<p>1. The app’s features – Does the app have all the features you need? For example does the app have a voice to text because that saves a doctors time.</p>



<p>2. The app’s ease of use – Is the app easy to use?</p>

<p>5. athenahealth</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The problem with these apps is</p>
</blockquote>



<p>1. They are not affordable for many doctors.</p>



<p>2. They have a lot of features that many doctors do not need.</p>



<p>3. They are not easy to use.</p>



<p>Updox, for example, lets a doctor</p>



<p>1. Schedule an appointment</p>



<p>2. Receive a patient’s medical history</p>



<p>3. Review lab results</p>



<p>4. Send a secure message</p>



<p>5. Get paid Doximity has a similar feature set.</p>



<p>Doctors spend most of their time writing prescriptions. So what to look for when picking a prescription app?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What makes a good prescription?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/prescription-56ad9f2a5f9b58b7d00b43f8-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-562" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/prescription-56ad9f2a5f9b58b7d00b43f8-1024x681.jpg 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/prescription-56ad9f2a5f9b58b7d00b43f8-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/prescription-56ad9f2a5f9b58b7d00b43f8-768x511.jpg 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/prescription-56ad9f2a5f9b58b7d00b43f8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A good digital prescription should be clear, concise, and easy to read. It should also include all of the necessary information for the patient, such as the name and dosage of the medication, the route of administration, and the frequency and duration of treatment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why do prescription apps make the best online consultations app for doctors?</h2>



<p>There are many reasons why prescription apps make the best online consultations app for doctors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="275" height="183" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-5.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-557"/></figure>



<p>First, they are convenient for both doctors and patients. Patients can easily schedule an appointment and fill out their medical history online. This saves time for both the doctor and the patient.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="523" height="280" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/handsome-senior-doctor-man-wearing-260nw-1282602445.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-558" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/handsome-senior-doctor-man-wearing-260nw-1282602445.webp 523w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/handsome-senior-doctor-man-wearing-260nw-1282602445-300x161.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /></figure>



<p>Second, prescription apps make it easy for doctors to keep track of their patients’ medical history. They can easily see what medications the patient is taking and whether they are having any side effects. This information is important for the doctor to know in order to provide the best care possible.</p>



<p>Third, prescription apps allow doctors to prescribe medications directly to their patients. This is convenient for both the doctor and the patient. The patient does not have to go to the pharmacy to pick up their prescription. The doctor can also be sure that the patient is taking the correct medication.</p>



<p>Fourth, prescription apps make it easy for doctors to monitor their patients’ progress. They can see how well the patient is responding to the medication and make changes if necessary. This helps the doctor to provide the best care possible. Overall, prescription apps make the best online consultations app for doctors.</p>

<p>This is a common problem that people face in finding their passion or purpose. I am going to talk about an easy two-step process to find your passion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: identify what you are naturally good at.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="720" height="432" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/illustration-muscle-work-leader.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-549" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/illustration-muscle-work-leader.jpeg 720w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/illustration-muscle-work-leader-300x180.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>Steve Jobs was naturally good at making things simple. Elon Musk is naturally good at being an engineer.</p>



<p>Please note that while answering this question for yourself the answer can’t be that “I am naturally good at baseball, basketball, etc”. If that is where your answer is going then look deeper.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>But how do you find what you are naturally good at?</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.1: Simply observe what you spend time doing.</h4>



<p>Write daily in detail about things that you are spending time on. For instance, I wrote yesterday “spent time comparing stocks and their PE ratio”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="814" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CoverImage-1024x814.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-550" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CoverImage-1024x814.webp 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CoverImage-300x238.webp 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CoverImage-768x610.webp 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CoverImage.webp 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Then over say a month, when you analyze you will see both what you are naturally good at and the challenges in those areas.</p>



<p>For me the analysis was I spend time meditating, writing blog posts, sculpting my body, web product development, etc.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1.2: Look deeper</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="727" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/main-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-551" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/main-1.png 600w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/main-1-248x300.png 248w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Pick each area and note the why?</p>



<p>For example, say you are naturally good at cooking but the underlying skill will be that you are naturally good at figuring out how things are going to combine and what results they create.</p>



<p>For me. The why for Mediation was? I am inclined towards the search for a calmer mind. Why Web product development? means that I like making complex things simple and the nature of products I build are complex and difficult so I need engineering challenges as well.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: not all areas you spend time on are your passions if they won’t have a good “Why”. People are forced into some jobs and activities but you can look at what aspect of that work you excel at.</p>



<p>Often your friends and colleagues are a good source to ask what they think makes you unique.</p>



<p>By now you should have found what you are naturally good at and also what your passions are.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Find areas that need your natural skill, and passion.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="1187" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61851be2b82096ac2d73b883_5f7efa69627027085425deae_Goal-Orientation-bubble2-1-1.svg" alt="" class="wp-image-552"/></figure>



<p>Phones, laptops, and music players are complex, so Steve Jobs chose that market to apply his natural skill of making things simple.</p>



<p>Electric cars, solar panels, and rockets require a lot of engineering so Elon Musk chose that market to apply his natural skills and love of engineering.</p>



<p>In my case, I am naturally good at making complex things simple. Stock research and analyzing a company is very complex, I plan to apply my skills to make this complex process simpler.</p>



<p>At this point your detailed observations will tell you the unsolved problems in the area you picked. For me, it was no easy way to compare stocks, and too much information, and opinions.</p>



<p>To conclude, to find your passion, discover what you are naturally good at by observing what you do each day. Then try to find which market needs your skills the most. And then just commit yourself to solving problems in that market by doing what you are naturally good at.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>By the way, this is called finding product founder market fit.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In my next post, I am going to give practical advice on how to innovate in the area you committed to devote your next 10 years to, stay tuned …</p>

<p>Most project management software focus more on providing task boards, ability to add tasks from chat applications like slack. However, the burden to send reminders if a task’s status was not updated, escalating a task if it was running behind, translating meeting notes into tasks, etc.</p>



<p>A common task that executive struggles with is constantly checking if people have updated the status, and then messaging the relevant team members if they have not.</p>



<p>Imagine an AI Status both that could be communicate to a spreadsheet, or to an application like Trello or JIRA.</p>



<p>A status checker and reminder bot will have to do two things :</p>



<ul>
<li>Access a spreadsheet, check if an entry has been made, and if not then send a message to the person.</li>



<li>It should send a reminder if a task is exceeding a certain time limit or overdue</li>



<li>Should create a new spreadsheet copying the tasks from the previous day, and then asking the user to update the status on those tasks</li>



<li>It should have a way to talk to it by telling it assign this task to person A, B, C and then those entries can be added in the spreadsheet</li>



<li>For each task that is assigned it should make sure that there is a person who is supposed to be doing the task and then there is a person that is supposed to review that tasks, and escalation list if the task is running late</li>



<li>It co-ordinates between the three, it reminds the task owner reminders to update the status of the task, when the task is complete, it sends a message to the reviewer, and escalates a task if it is running late.</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with a status checker bot you also need an AI bot which can listen into a meeting, take notes, and then convert the notes into action items, and then guess who the action item belongs to, and if it can’t figure it out, then messages the meeting owner to clarify the tasks.</p>



<ul>
<li>Being able to import the audio, and the associated transcript</li>



<li>Being able to convert the transcript, into a list of action items with the owner of the task</li>



<li>Confirming the task list with the meeting owner</li>



<li>Sending the confirmed task list to the status checker bot</li>
</ul>



<p>If done well, an AI system here, could simply make an office extremely productive. The next step in this AI vision is a focus bot. The job of the focus bot will be able to ensure that people are only working on one thing at a time, and the thing that they are working on has the highest impact on the KPIs. The bot will, again check the status sheet and ensure that one person is not having multiple tasks assigned to them and if one person has been assigned multiple things then it would escalate the list of multiple tasks and will ask the task assigner to prioritise.</p>



<p>The roadmap bot will take the unassigned tasks and suggestions into a backlog list. The roadmap bot will categorize the tasks based on various teams (e.g. marketing, QA, design, development, dev operations, etc.), it would have the ability to merge different tasks together, identify duplicate tasks, and combine tasks to create a more comprehensive tasks</p>



<ul>
<li>Make sure the roadmap tasks are prioritised and mapped to the OKRs</li>



<li>Ensure that tasks are not duplicate, and provide a way to merge two overlapping tasks</li>



<li>Classify a task to the right team</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine if you can connect to a friends computer and use that to speed up training of your model.</p>



<p>Training ML models is very expensive, and ML techniques require many iterations hence they require speed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution: Distributed Computing</h4>



<p>Distributed training is a technique that allows you to train machine learning models using multiple computers. This can be useful when you have large datasets or models that are too computationally intensive to train on a single computer.</p>



<p>Changing is setting up the infrastructure to enable multiple computers to work together. One way to do this is to use a Common Internet File System (CIFS) to share data and resources between the computers.</p>



<p>To set up a CIFS, you can use a single script that is capable of running on multiple operating systems (OS). This script can be used to install the necessary software and configure the CIFS on each computer. For example, on a Linux computer, the script can install the CIFS utilities and configure the Samba server, while on a MacOS or Windows computer, the script can install the SMBFS or SAMBA command-line utilities and mount the shared directory.</p>



<p>Once the CIFS is set up, you can start the model training process on each computer. By starting the same training process on different computers, you can connect the various training processes and allow them to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>The various training processes communicate with each other using a process called message passing. This involves sending messages between the computers to exchange information about the model training, such as the gradients of the model parameters. The computers also discover each other using a process called process discovery. This involves identifying the other computers that are part of the distributed training process and determining how to communicate with them.</p>



<p>In summary, distributed training allows you to train machine learning models using multiple computers. By setting up a CIFS and starting the same training process on different computers, you can connect the various training processes and enable them to communicate and discover each other. This can be useful when you have large datasets or models that are too computationally intensive to train on a single computer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to start, stop training on the various computers?</h4>



<p>To start and stop model training on the computers connected to a Common Internet File System (CIFS) using PyTorch, you can use the following techniques:</p>



<ol>
<li>Start training on all computers simultaneously: You can start training on all computers simultaneously by running the training script on each computer at the same time. This can be done manually by starting the script on each computer, or automatically using a tool like&nbsp;<code>fabric</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>.</li>



<li>Start training on one computer and then add more computers: You can start training on one computer and then add more computers to the training process as needed. To do this, you can use the&nbsp;<code>torch.nn.DataParallel</code>&nbsp;wrapper to parallelize the model training across the computers. You can then add more computers to the training process by adding them to the&nbsp;<code>DataParallel</code>&nbsp;wrapper. For example:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">import torch<br><br># Set the data directory to the mount point<br>data_dir = "/path/to/mount/point"<br><br># Load the dataset<br>dataset = torch.utils.data.DatasetFolder(data_dir, ...)<br><br># Set up the model and DataParallel wrapper with one computer<br>model = MyModel()<br>model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model, device_ids=[0])<br><br># Use DataParallel to parallelize the model training<br>for input, target in dataset:<br>    output = model(input)<br>    loss = loss_fn(output, target)<br>    loss.backward()<br>    optimizer.step()<br><br># Add more computers to the DataParallel wrapper<br>model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model, device_ids=[0, 1, 2])</pre>



<p>This will allow you to start training on one computer and then add more computers to the training process as needed.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Stop training on one or more computers: To stop training on one or more computers, you can simply stop the training script on those computers.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code that demonstrates and tests the CLIFS set up</h2>



<p>To demonstrate and test the Common Internet File System (CIFS) set up, you can write a Python script that performs the following tasks:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a test file on one of the computers.</li>



<li>Check if the test file is accessible from the other computers.</li>



<li>Modify the test file on one of the computers.</li>



<li>Check if the modifications are reflected on the other computers.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here is an example of a Python script that demonstrates and tests the CIFS set up:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">import os<br><br># Create a test file on one of the computers<br>with open("Z:/test.txt", "w") as f:<br>    f.write("This is a test file.")<br><br># Check if the test file is accessible from the other computers<br>if os.path.exists("/path/to/mount/point/test.txt"):<br>    print("Test file is accessible from the other computers.")<br>else:<br>    print("Test file is not accessible from the other computers.")<br><br># Modify the test file on one of the computers<br>with open("Z:/test.txt", "a") as f:<br>    f.write("\nThis line was added later.")<br><br># Check if the modifications are reflected on the other computers<br>with open("/path/to/mount/point/test.txt", "r") as f:<br>    content = f.read()<br>    if "This line was added later." in content:<br>        print("Modifications are reflected on the other computers.")<br>    else:<br>        print("Modifications are not reflected on the other computers</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Setting up CIFS</h4>



<p>Here is a Python script that you can use to detect the operating system, IP address, and set up a Common Internet File System (CIFS) on each computer:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">import platform<br>import os<br><br># Detect the operating system<br>os_name = platform.system()<br><br># Get the IP address<br>ip_address = os.popen('hostname -I').read()<br>ip_address = ip_address.strip()<br><br># Set up the CIFS file system<br>if os_name == "Linux":<br>    # Install the CIFS utilities<br>    os.system("sudo apt-get install cifs-utils")<br><br>    # Create a shared directory<br>    os.system("mkdir /path/to/shared/directory")<br><br>    # Edit the Samba configuration file<br>    with open("/etc/samba/smb.conf", "a") as f:<br>        f.write("\n[shared]\n")<br>        f.write("path = /path/to/shared/directory\n")<br>        f.write("writable = yes\n")<br>        f.write("guest ok = yes\n")<br><br>    # Restart the Samba server<br>    os.system("sudo systemctl restart smbd")<br><br>elif os_name == "Darwin":<br>    # Install the SMBFS or SAMBA command-line utilities<br>    os.system("brew install smbfs")<br>    # or<br>    os.system("brew install samba")<br><br>    # Create a mount point<br>    os.system("mkdir /path/to/mount/point")<br><br>    # Mount the shared directory<br>    os.system("sudo mount_smbfs //guest@{}/shared /path/to/mount/point".format(ip_address))<br><br>elif os_name == "Windows":<br>    # Mount the shared directory using the "net use" command<br>    os.system("net use Z: \\\\{}\\shared".format(ip_address))<br><br>else:<br>    print("Unsupported operating system.")<br><br>print("CIFS file system set up complete.")</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tying it up all together</h2>



<p>To set up a distributed training environment on multiple computers using a main computer and the username and password provided by the computer owners, you can use a tool that automates the installation and configuration of software on remote servers. One such tool is&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>, which is a configuration management tool that allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure and then automatically enforce that state.</p>



<p>Here is an example of how you can use&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>&nbsp;to set up a distributed training environment on multiple computers, including the Common Internet File System (CIFS), PyTorch, training script, dataset, etc., and then execute the training:</p>



<ol>
<li>Write an&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>&nbsp;playbook that specifies the required steps to set up the training environment. For example:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">---<br>- name: Set up distributed training environment<br>  hosts: all<br>  tasks:<br>    - name: Install Python<br>      package:<br>        name: python3<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install PyTorch<br>      pip:<br>        name: torch<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install CIFS utilities<br>      package:<br>        name: cifs-utils<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Mount shared directory<br>      mount:<br>        path: /path/to/mount/point<br>        src: //10.0.0.1/shared<br>        fstype: cifs<br>        opts: username=guest,password=password<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install training code<br>      copy:<br>        src: training.py<br>        dest: /opt/training/training.py<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install dataset<br>      copy:<br>        src: dataset.zip<br>        dest: /opt/training/dataset.zip<br>      become: yes<br>      unarchive:<br>        src: /opt/training/dataset.zip<br>        dest: /opt/training/<br>        remote_src: true<br><br>    - name: Execute training<br>      command: python3 /opt/training/training.py<br>      become:<br>---<br>- name: Set up distributed training environment<br>  hosts: all<br>  tasks:<br>    - name: Install Python<br>      package:<br>        name: python3<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install PyTorch<br>      pip:<br>        name: torch<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install CIFS utilities<br>      package:<br>        name: cifs-utils<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Mount shared directory<br>      mount:<br>        path: /path/to/mount/point<br>        src: //10.0.0.1/shared<br>        fstype: cifs<br>        opts: username=guest,password=password<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install training code<br>      copy:<br>        src: training.py<br>        dest: /opt/training/training.py<br>      become: yes<br><br>    - name: Install dataset<br>      copy:<br>        src: dataset.zip<br>        dest: /opt/training/dataset.zip<br>      become: yes<br>      unarchive:<br>        src: /opt/training/dataset.zip<br>        dest: /opt/training/<br>        remote_src: true<br><br>    - name: Execute training<br>      command: python3 /opt/training/training.py<br>      become: yes</pre>



<p>Create an&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>&nbsp;inventory file that specifies the connection information for the computers. For example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">[windows]<br>windows_computer ansible_user=username ansible_password=password<br><br>[linux]<br>linux_computer ansible_user=username ansible_password=password<br><br>[mac]<br>mac_computer ansible_user=username ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/keyfile</pre>



<p>Use&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>&nbsp;to apply the playbook to the computers. For example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml</pre>



<p>To allow a non-technical person to provide the information that&nbsp;<code>ansible</code>&nbsp;requires to connect to their computer, you can follow these steps:</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is TRLX?</h4>



<p>TRLX is a framework that uses Hugging Face transformers pipeline object to fine tune a model using RLHF.</p>



<p>Transformer Reinforcement Learning X (TRLX) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines the capabilities of the Transformer model with reinforcement learning. The Transformer model is a powerful AI technique that is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as language translation or text summarization. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves rewarding or punishing a model based on its actions in order to improve its performance over time.</p>



<p>By combining these two techniques, TRLX allows robots to learn and adapt their behavior based on feedback from their environment and users. For example, a robot that uses TRLX might be trained to perform a specific task, such as cleaning a room or picking up objects. As the robot performs the task, it receives feedback from its sensors and users, and uses this feedback to adjust its behavior and improve its performance.</p>



<p>TRLX has the potential to improve the performance and efficiency of robots in a wide range of applications, including manufacturing, logistics, and customer service. By allowing robots to learn and adapt based on feedback from their environment and users, TRLX can help robots to become more intelligent, flexible, and useful.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is RLHF?</h4>



<p>RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/65249_ateacherstandingnexttoastudentscoringtheworkofthes.png" alt="" class="wp-image-927"/></figure>



<p>RLHF, or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows robots to learn and improve their behavior based on feedback from human users. This is different from traditional AI, which is pre-programmed with a set of rules and behaviors that it follows without adapting to its environment or users.</p>



<p>RLHF uses a technique called reinforcement learning, which involves rewarding the robot for behaviours that are beneficial to the user, and punishing the robot for behaviours that are harmful or undesirable. Over time, this reinforcement process helps the robot to learn and adapt its behavior to better meet the needs and preferences of its human users.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1 : Installation</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>!git clone https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx.git
%cd trlx
!pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
!pip install -e .</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Setting up the environment</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import pipeline
import os
import yaml

import trlx
import torch
from typing import List
from trlx.data.configs import TRLConfig</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Fine Tune your Language Model (optional)</h4>



<p>This is an optional step but highly recommended for serious applications. We pick GPT because it is particularly good at text generation tasks. Here is an example of code that shows how to fine-tune a Hugging Face GPT language model:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># Import the Hugging Face transformers library
import transformers

# Load the GPT language model that you want to fine-tune
model = transformers.GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('&lt;model_name&gt;')

# Set the training parameters, such as the batch size and number of epochs
batch_size = 16
num_epochs = 5

# Define the dataset and dataloader for the model
dataset = transformers.LineByLineTextDataset(...)
dataloader = transformers.DataLoader(...)

# Set the optimizer and learning rate for the model
optimizer = transformers.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

# Train the model for the specified number of epochs
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Train the model on the training data
    model.train()
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(input_ids=batch&#91;'input_ids'], attention_mask=batch&#91;'attention_mask'])
        loss = outputs&#91;0]
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained('&lt;model_name&gt;')
</code></pre>



<p>This code shows the basic steps for fine-tuning a Hugging Face language model. First, the model is loaded from a pre-trained checkpoint. Next, the training parameters, such as the batch size and number of epochs, are set. The dataset and dataloader are then defined, and the optimizer and learning rate are set for the model.</p>



<p>Finally, the model is trained for the specified number of epochs, using the training data provided in the dataloader. After training, the fine-tuned model is saved and loaded in the next step.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/457184_batmanoperatingtheradiointhecarCinematicextremelyd.png" alt="" class="wp-image-928"/></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Create a pipeline</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sentiment_fn = pipeline(
        "sentiment-analysis",
        "lvwerra/distilbert-imdb",
        top_k=2,
        truncation=True,
        batch_size=256,
        device=device,
    )</code></pre>



<p>In the code above we used the pre-trained model lvwerra/distilbert-imdb and the sentiment analysis pipeline, but it could have been your fine tuned model and a different pipeline. The Hugging Face transformers provide a variety of pipelines that can be used for different natural language processing tasks. Some of the pipelines that are available include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sentiment analysis: This pipeline can be used to predict the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of a given text.</li>



<li>Text generation: This pipeline can be used to generate new text based on a given prompt or input.</li>



<li>Text classification: This pipeline can be used to classify a given text into one or more pre-defined categories.</li>



<li>Named entity recognition: This pipeline can be used to identify and extract named entities (such as people, organizations, or locations) from a given text.</li>



<li>Question answering: This pipeline can be used to generate answers to questions based on a given text or document.</li>



<li>Summarization: This pipeline can be used to generate a concise summary of a given text or document.</li>



<li>Translation: This pipeline can be used to translate a given text from one language to another.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few examples of the pipelines that are available with the Hugging Face transformers. There are many other pipelines available, and new ones are being added all the time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Create prompts</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>    # Take few words off of movies reviews as prompts
    imdb = load_dataset("imdb", split="train+test")
    prompts = &#91;" ".join(review.split()&#91;:4]) for review in imdb&#91;"text"]]</code></pre>



<p>There are several different ways that you can create prompts. Some of the most common methods include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Using a pre-defined prompt: Many language models come with a set of pre-defined prompts that can be used to generate text or answers to questions. For example, a language model might include prompts such as “Tell me a story about a robot” or “Explain the concept of reinforcement learning in simple terms.”</li>



<li>Providing your own prompt: In many cases, you can also create your own custom prompts by providing a sentence, paragraph, or other text as input to the language model. For example, you might provide a prompt such as “Describe the benefits of using a large language model” or “Write a poem about the beauty of nature.”</li>
</ul>



<p>In the move review dataset we simply truncated and used the first 5 words as the prompt. The prompt will be what you have fine-tuned your model to do.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 6: Reward Function</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>def get_positive_score(scores):
    "Extract value associated with a positive sentiment from pipeline's output"
    return dict(map(lambda x: tuple(x.values()), scores))&#91;"POSITIVE"]

def reward_fn(samples: List&#91;str]) -&gt; List&#91;float]:
        sentiments = list(map(get_positive_score, sentiment_fn(samples)))
        return sentiments</code></pre>



<p>What this code is doing is taking the output of the pipeline, i.e. output of the prompts that you created earlier, and then scoring that output. Since in this sample example we are trying to use RLHF to generate positive reviews, we are only returning back the confidence score of the positive sentiment classification. This is key</p>



<p>To illustrate with another example. Imagine you have a text classification model that classifies text into various classes (For instance, Factual, Opinionated, Impactful, and Useful), and your goal is to train a model to generate more Useful text then you simply return the Useful score of the classification.</p>



<p>Do note that in the example above the output of the sentiment analysis pipeline in itself is a classification (Positive, Negative), but in case of text generation models like GPT you could have taken the output of the prompt and fed that output into a different text classification model, and taken the scores of the class you care about (e.g. Useful class) and then made that was the reward.</p>



<p>I hope you can see the immense power behind this training technique. The rewards could be coming from another model, or could be coming directly from some human raters (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk). In Chat GPT they went ahead and first collected ratings from human raters and then fine-tuned a language model on predicting the ratings given the pair of prompt, and generated text.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 7: Train using TRLX library</h4>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code> model = trlx.train(
        reward_fn=reward_fn,
        prompts=prompts,
        eval_prompts=&#91;"I don't know much about Hungarian underground"] * 64,
        config=config,
    )</code></pre>



<p>eval_prompts are prompts to periodically validate training on. The idea is that theses prompts will never be used in learning, but purely as a way to evaluate the training. In the example above is a primitive way to give a list of 64 prompts all repeated but in a real example these would be carefully selected prompts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>



<p>So there you have it, in this post I covered the logical structure of how to do RLHF training (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). I intentionally skipped many details to make sure this tutorial is intuitive. In the next part I am going to cover how to actually run this training, since it can be computationally expensive. I will be focussing on the real challenges of running this training in a cost effective manner. I will be trying to make this run on a Google Colab, and will share my learnings. So stay tuned or subscribe.</p>
