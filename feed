<p>Training large language models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 is an expensive task that requires a lot of computational resources, time, and money. In this blog post, we will discuss some cost-saving strategies that can be used while training these models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Training Large Language Models is So Expensive?</h3>



<p>Large language models are expensive to train because they require vast amounts of computational resources, such as GPU/CPU, memory, and storage. Training a language model on a single machine can take days or even weeks, depending on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. The cost of renting these resources from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be quite high. To put it in perspective, training GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, would cost approximately $4.6 million on AWS.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Spot Instances as a Solution</h3>



<p>AWS offers a cost-effective solution to reduce the cost of training large language models &#8211; Spot instances. Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that are available for purchase at a significantly lower price than on-demand instances. AWS offers these instances at a discount of up to 90% compared to on-demand instances. Spot instances are a great option for training large language models since the training process is not time-sensitive, and the task can be divided into smaller chunks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Spot Instances</h3>



<p>To use Spot instances, you need to request them using the AWS Management Console or the AWS SDK. Spot instances are available until the price exceeds your maximum bid, at which point the instance is terminated. However, using spot instances has its challenges. The instance can be terminated at any time, causing the work to be lost, and the training process to start from scratch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a Boot Snapshot Volume</h3>



<p>To prevent losing work when a Spot instance is terminated, you can create a boot snapshot volume. A boot snapshot volume contains the operating system, the application, and any data that was present on the instance. When a new instance is created, this volume can be attached, allowing you to resume work from where you left off. By doing this, you can significantly reduce the time and money spent on training large language models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges with Spot Instances and GPU Limits</h3>



<p>While Spot instances are a cost-effective solution for training large language models, AWS and other cloud companies impose limits on the type of spot instances that have GPU, making it challenging to procure the necessary resources to train these models. These limits can significantly impact the training time and, consequently, the overall cost of the project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Requesting a Limit Increase</h3>



<p>To overcome this challenge, you can request a limit increase for the GPU instances from AWS or the cloud provider you are using. The process involves submitting a support ticket requesting an increase in the limit for the specific instance type. AWS has a dedicated portal for requesting limit increases, making the process more streamlined.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Getting Your Limit Increase Approved</h3>



<p>Getting a limit increase approved can be a daunting task, but there are ways to increase the chances of approval. Here are some tips to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Justify your request &#8211; provide a detailed explanation of why you need a limit increase, including the nature of your workload, the size of your dataset, and the complexity of the model.</li>



<li>Demonstrate cost optimization &#8211; show that using Spot instances is a cost-effective solution compared to using on-demand instances, which can help justify the increase in limit.</li>



<li>Highlight past successes &#8211; showcase past successes in training large language models, using similar or the same resources, to demonstrate your ability to manage the workload effectively.</li>



<li>Be specific &#8211; provide detailed information on the exact type of instance you need and the number required to complete the task.</li>



<li>Plan ahead &#8211; request the limit increase well in advance to allow enough time for approval and procurement of the required resources.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Size of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>



<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or ChatGPT can get extremely large, often requiring hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of storage space. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and requires 800 GB of storage space. The size of these models makes it challenging to move data from one instance to another, increasing the overall cost and time required to train the models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges of Moving Data between Instances</h3>



<p>Moving data between instances can be a time-consuming and expensive process. It involves copying large amounts of data over the network, which can take hours or even days, depending on the size of the data and the network speed. Additionally, copying data can also incur additional costs, such as network bandwidth fees, which can add up quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use object storage</h3>



<p>Storing data in object storage services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage can make it easier to move data between instances. Object storage services allow you to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, reducing the time and cost of moving data between instances.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Connecting to a Spot Instance using SSH: Challenges and Solutions</h3>



<p>When using Spot instances for training large language models, connecting to the instance using SSH can be a challenge.</p>



<p>Firewall settings: Firewall settings can prevent you from connecting to your Spot instance using SSH. If your firewall is not set up correctly, you may receive a &#8220;Connection Refused&#8221; error when trying to connect to the instance.</p>



<p>Solution: To overcome this challenge, ensure that the security group settings for your Spot instance allow incoming SSH traffic. You can do this by adding a rule to the security group to allow incoming traffic on port 22, which is the default port used for SSH.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Max Spot Request Count Exceeded: Causes and Solutions</h3>



<p>Another challenge that can occur when using Spot instances for training large language models is the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error. This error occurs when you have submitted the maximum number of Spot instance requests that you can submit in a specific period.</p>



<p>Here are some common causes of the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error and ways to avoid it:</p>



<ol>
<li>AWS account limits: Your AWS account may have a limit on the number of Spot instance requests that you can submit in a specific period.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To avoid this error, you can request a limit increase from AWS. You may need to provide information on how you plan to use the additional requests and the expected workload. If your request is approved, you can submit more requests and continue your training.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Spot instance launch frequency: When using Spot instances, there is a limit on how frequently you can launch new instances. If you exceed this limit, you may receive the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To avoid this error, you can adjust the frequency of Spot instance launches. This can include launching instances less frequently or using tools like EC2 Auto Scaling to launch new instances based on workload and availability.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Spot instance termination: Similar to the &#8220;Max Spot Instance Count Exceeded&#8221; error, the risk of Spot instance termination can also cause the &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; error. When a Spot instance is terminated, it counts as a new request.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To avoid this error, you can use the same strategies as mentioned before to manage the risk of Spot instance termination. This can include launching a mix of Spot and On-Demand instances or using tools like EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain a minimum number of running instances.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Picking the Right AMI with Drivers Installed: Challenges and Solutions</h3>



<p>When training large language models using Spot instances, it&#8217;s important to choose the right Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that includes the necessary drivers installed. This can be a challenging task, but there are solutions to help streamline the process.</p>



<p>Here are some common challenges when picking the right AMI with drivers installed and ways to overcome them:</p>



<ol>
<li>Finding the right AMI: With so many different AMIs available on the AWS Marketplace, it can be challenging to find the one that includes the specific drivers required for your workload.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: One solution is to use AWS Deep Learning AMIs, which include popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. These AMIs also include pre-installed drivers for popular GPUs like NVIDIA, making it easier to get started with training large language models.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Customizing the AMI: In some cases, you may need to customize the AMI to include additional drivers or software required for your specific workload.</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To customize an AMI, you can use the AWS Systems Manager to create a custom image that includes the necessary drivers and software. This image can then be used to launch Spot instances for your training workload.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Keeping drivers up to date: As new versions of drivers are released, it can be challenging to keep your AMI up to date with the latest drivers.</li>



<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Solution: To keep your AMI up to date with the latest drivers, you can use automation tools like AWS Systems Manager Automation to automate the process of updating the drivers. This can help ensure that your AMI is always up to date and optimized for your training workload.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>



<p>In this post, we discussed the cost-saving strategies for training large language models like ChatGPT/GPT-4 using AWS Spot instances. We first explained why training large language models can be expensive and gave examples of how expensive it can get. We then talked about how Spot instances can be an effective solution for cost-saving and how creating a boot snapshot volume can help resume work when a new instance is created.</p>



<p>We also addressed challenges like AWS imposing limits on the type of spot instances that have GPUs, connecting to the spot instance using SSH, and avoiding the &#8220;Max Spot Instance Count Exceeded&#8221; and &#8220;Max Spot Request Count Exceeded&#8221; errors. Lastly, we talked about the importance of choosing the right AMI with drivers installed and provided solutions to overcome the challenges of finding the right AMI and keeping drivers up to date.</p>



<p>In conclusion, training large language models can be a costly process, but using AWS Spot instances, creating a boot snapshot volume, and choosing the right AMI with drivers installed can help optimize cost and performance. Additionally, it is important to plan and manage the availability of Spot instances and minimize the risk of errors to ensure a smooth training process.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part 1</h3>



<p>A company I was advising had a bitter sweet situation. This is what he wrote</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>As the founder of a bootstrapped SAAS company that uses React, NodeJS, and runs on AWS, I recently received interest from a Fortune 500 company to buy a monthly subscription of my product. However, the CTO mentioned that my company would need to comply with various requirements, such as insurance, SOX compliance, GDPR, and more. I&#8217;m not sure why the CTO is asking for these compliance measures when other SAAS startups don&#8217;t seem to have to go through this process. I&#8217;m curious about the legal requirements that the CTO needs to meet, and I wonder if they ask for these same compliance measures from other SAAS companies like Office 365 or Oracle.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Software Compliance is a major pain</h3>



<p>Software compliance can be a major pain point for bootstrapped founders of SAAS products. Compliance requirements can be complex, time-consuming, and costly, which can be particularly challenging for startups with limited resources. Failure to meet compliance standards can result in significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. Moreover, compliance requirements are constantly evolving, requiring ongoing efforts to stay up-to-date. As a result, compliance can be a major obstacle for bootstrapped SAAS companies seeking to grow their customer base and compete with larger, established players in the industry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">List of the most common compliance requirements</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Compliance Requirement</th><th>Importance (Low/Medium/High)</th><th>Estimated Time to Achieve</th><th>Estimated Cost to Achieve</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data Privacy and Security (e.g. GDPR)</td><td>High</td><td>2-4 weeks</td><td>$5,000-$10,000</td></tr><tr><td>PCI-DSS Compliance</td><td>Medium</td><td>4-6 weeks</td><td>$10,000-$15,000</td></tr><tr><td>SOC 2 Compliance</td><td>High</td><td>8-12 weeks</td><td>$25,000-$50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Planning</td><td>Medium</td><td>2-4 weeks</td><td>$5,000-$10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance Requirements</td><td>Medium</td><td>1-2 weeks</td><td>$2,000-$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Compliance (e.g. SOX)</td><td>High</td><td>4-6 weeks</td><td>$10,000-$20,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Note that these estimates are rough and can vary depending on the scope of the compliance requirement, the industry, and the specific needs of the company.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Compliance Requirements based on Location</h3>



<p>If the SAAS company is located in the US but has a development center in India, there may be additional compliance requirements to consider. For example, the company may need to comply with data protection laws in both the US and India, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and the Indian Data Protection Bill. The company may also need to comply with export control laws, such as the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Indian Export-Import (EXIM) Policy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Documents that you would have to provide the CTO or the legal department of the larger company</h3>



<p>Some common documents that they may request include:</p>



<ol>
<li>Proof of insurance coverage, including general liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance, and cyber liability insurance.</li>



<li>Completed security and compliance questionnaires or assessments, such as the Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaire or the Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) assessment.</li>



<li>Copies of compliance certifications, such as SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, or PCI-DSS.</li>



<li>Privacy policies and terms of service agreements that comply with relevant data protection laws, such as GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</li>



<li>Completed vendor risk assessments, which may include questions about the company&#8217;s financial stability, disaster recovery plans, and cybersecurity practices.</li>



<li>Attestations of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</li>



<li>Evidence of adherence to specific technical standards, such as the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) or the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here&#8217;s a table that lists the Minimum Viable way to complete each compliance requirement, any software or open source tools that can help achieve it, and a brief outline of the inputs required to obtain certification:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Compliance Requirement</th><th>Minimum Viable Way to Complete</th><th>Software/Open Source/Non-Profit to Help</th><th>Inputs Required for Certification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Insurance Coverage</td><td>Contact an insurance broker to obtain a quote for General Liability and Errors &amp; Omissions (E&amp;O) insurance</td><td>None</td><td>Completed application for insurance coverage</td></tr><tr><td>SOC 2 Type 2</td><td>Implement security controls and processes that align with SOC 2 requirements, conduct a self-audit, and engage a third-party auditor to conduct a SOC 2 Type 2 audit</td><td>Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR, NIST Cybersecurity Framework</td><td>Completed SOC 2 Type 2 audit report</td></tr><tr><td>GDPR</td><td>Conduct a data inventory, update privacy policies and notices, and establish data subject access request (DSAR) and data breach notification processes</td><td>TrustArc, OneTrust, openGDPR</td><td>Completed GDPR compliance assessment</td></tr><tr><td>Vendor Risk Assessment</td><td>Complete a vendor security questionnaire provided by the customer or a third-party vendor risk management platform</td><td>BitSight, SecurityScorecard, RiskRecon</td><td>Completed vendor security questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td>Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)</td><td>Implement controls and processes to ensure the accuracy and integrity of financial reporting, and engage a third-party auditor to conduct a SOX audit</td><td>None</td><td>Completed SOX audit report</td></tr><tr><td>ISO 27001</td><td>Implement security controls and processes that align with ISO 27001 requirements, conduct a self-audit, and engage a third-party auditor to conduct an ISO 27001 certification audit</td><td>NIST Cybersecurity Framework, CIS Controls</td><td>Completed ISO 27001 certification audit report</td></tr><tr><td>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)</td><td>Implement security controls and processes that align with PCI-DSS requirements, conduct a self-assessment or engage a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) to conduct a PCI-DSS assessment</td><td>PCI Security Standards Council, Trustwave, Coalfire</td><td>Completed PCI-DSS self-assessment or QSA report</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Note that the specific inputs required for certification may vary depending on the certification program or standard being followed, and it is important to consult the relevant certification body or auditor for specific guidance.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s generally better to qualify a prospect or lead first before giving them a product demo or pitch. This allows you to determine if the prospect is a good fit for your product or service and if they have the potential to become a customer.</p>



<p>Qualifying a lead typically involves gathering information about their needs, budget, timeline, and decision-making process. Once you have this information, you can use it to determine whether your product or service is a good fit for their needs and whether it&#8217;s worth investing time and resources in a demo or pitch.</p>



<p>If the prospect meets your criteria and appears to be a good fit, then you can proceed with a product demo or pitch. This will give you the opportunity to showcase the benefits and features of your product or service and explain how it can meet the prospect&#8217;s needs.</p>



<p>However, if the prospect doesn&#8217;t meet your criteria or appears to be a poor fit for your product or service, then it may be best to move on and focus your efforts on other leads who are more likely to become customers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Navigating a difficult / arrogant prospect</h3>



<p>Here are some phrases you can use to encourage the prospect to share more information and engage in a conversation about their needs, even when they are focused on seeing a demo:</p>



<ol>
<li>&#8220;Before we jump into the demo, I&#8217;d love to hear more about your current situation and what you&#8217;re hoping to achieve with our product. Can you tell me a bit more about that?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I completely understand you&#8217;re excited to see our product, but understanding your needs will help us customize the demo to your specific situation. Can you share some more information about your company&#8217;s goals?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to give you a demo that&#8217;s tailored to your specific needs. Can you tell me more about your current workflow and what challenges you&#8217;re currently facing?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;We can definitely show you how our product works, but it would be really helpful to understand more about your company and what you&#8217;re looking for. Can you share some details about your current process and pain points?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to give you a demo, but before we get started, could you give me some more context about your role and how our product would fit into your workflow?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I want to make sure our demo is as useful as possible for you. Can you give me some more information about your decision-making process and what criteria you&#8217;re using to evaluate solutions like ours?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re interested in our product, but to make sure it&#8217;s the right fit for you, I&#8217;d love to hear more about your business and the challenges you&#8217;re facing. Can you share some more information about that?&#8221;</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does the lead qualification happen before or after the discovery call?</h3>



<p>During a discovery call, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to learn more about the lead&#8217;s needs and how your product or service can help solve their problems. However, if the lead doesn&#8217;t meet your qualification criteria, it may not be worth investing the time and resources into a discovery call.</p>



<p>By qualifying leads before the discovery call, you can ensure that you&#8217;re focusing your efforts on those who are more likely to become customers, and that you&#8217;re not wasting time on leads that aren&#8217;t a good fit for your product or service.</p>



<p>When a cold lead asks why you&#8217;re calling and what you have to offer, it&#8217;s important to start by providing a brief introduction and explanation of what your company does, but also to quickly pivot to asking some qualifying questions. Here&#8217;s an example of how you could respond:</p>



<p>&#8220;Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I&#8217;m calling from [Your Company]. We specialize in [Your Product/Service] and I wanted to see if you might be interested in learning more. But before I jump into details, could you tell me a bit more about your current process and the challenges you&#8217;re facing in your industry? This will help me better understand if we might be a good fit for your needs.&#8221;</p>



<p>By starting with a brief introduction and explanation of what your company does, you acknowledge the reason for your call and help the prospect understand why you&#8217;re reaching out. However, by quickly pivoting to asking some qualifying questions, you demonstrate that you&#8217;re interested in understanding their needs and challenges, rather than just pitching your product/service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cold calling rules</h3>



<p>The 3&#215;3 Rule by Trish Bertuzzi: Trish Bertuzzi, author of &#8220;The Sales Development Playbook,&#8221; recommends the 3&#215;3 rule for cold calling. This involves making three calls to the same prospect over three days, leaving a different voicemail message each time. The first message is an introduction and a reason for calling, the second is a reminder of the first message and a new value proposition, and the third is a final reminder and a call-to-action.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Hook, Line, and Sinker&#8221; Method by John Barrows: John Barrows, sales trainer and consultant, recommends the &#8220;hook, line, and sinker&#8221; method for cold calling. The hook is a strong opening statement that grabs the prospect&#8217;s attention, the line is a brief explanation of what you do and why you&#8217;re calling, and the sinker is a question that engages the prospect in a conversation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some cold calling tips shared by sales experts in their interviews:</h3>



<p>&#8220;The goal of the first call should not be to sell, but to get the prospect to engage in a conversation with you.&#8221; &#8211; Jeb Blount</p>



<p>&#8220;Before you make a cold call, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target market and your ideal customer profile.&#8221; &#8211; Jill Konrath</p>



<p>&#8220;Be confident and enthusiastic when making your cold call. People can hear your smile through the phone.&#8221; &#8211; John Barrows</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The paradox</h3>



<p>The fundamental challenge you have to solve is that lead or prospect wants to know what I have to offer, the demo, etc, and on the other hand you want to ask him questions, engage him in conversations, qualify, etc. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">How to deal with this paradox?</h5>



<p>The key to resolving this paradox is to balance the prospect&#8217;s desire to learn about your product or service with your need to gather information and qualify them as a potential customer. Here are a few strategies that can help:</p>



<ol>
<li>it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that interest and let them know that you understand why they&#8217;re curious. You might say something like, &#8220;I appreciate your enthusiasm for our product, and I&#8217;d be happy to show you how it works. But before we dive into the demo, I&#8217;d like to ask you a few questions to make sure that it&#8217;s a good fit for your needs.&#8221;</li>



<li>Provide a high-level overview: Instead of launching directly into a full product demo, you might consider giving the prospect a brief overview of what your product or service does and how it can benefit them. This can help establish context and give them a sense of why they should be interested, without overwhelming them with too much information too quickly.</li>



<li>Ask open-ended questions: One way to engage the prospect in conversation and gather information is to ask open-ended questions that encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings. For example, you might ask, &#8220;Can you tell me more about your current process for [specific task]?&#8221; or &#8220;What are some of the biggest challenges you&#8217;ve faced in [specific area]?&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>Creating an IAM profile in AWS can be a complex process, especially for those who are new to AWS or have limited experience with cloud computing. There are many different policies to choose from, and selecting the appropriate policies can be a challenge. Additionally, ensuring that the permissions are set up correctly and that the user has access to the appropriate resources can be time-consuming and require a lot of attention to detail.</p>



<p>Step 1 : go to IAM service page and click on add users</p>

<p>Here are some groups that you might want to create, and the policies you would most likely want to attach</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>AWS Permission Group</th><th>Policies Attached</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Developer group</td><td>AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AWSLambda_FullAccess, AWSCodeCommitPowerUser, AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess, AWSCodeDeployFullAccess, AWSCodePipeline_FullAccess, AWSXRayFullAccess</td></tr><tr><td>Administrator group</td><td>AdministratorAccess, AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonRDSFullAccess, AWSLambda_FullAccess, AWSCodeCommitFullAccess, AWSCodeBuildFullAccess, AWSCodeDeployFullAccess, AWSCodePipelineFullAccess, AWSXRayFullAccess</td></tr><tr><td>Billing group</td><td>Billing, CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess</td></tr><tr><td>Security group</td><td>SecurityAudit, AWSConfigRole</td></tr><tr><td>Support group</td><td>AWSHealthFullAccess, AWSSupportAccess</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Step 4: Select the group</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="911" src="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?resize=1024%2C911&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1266" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?resize=1024%2C911&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?resize=768%2C683&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?resize=1536%2C1366&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?resize=600%2C534&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9.png?w=1680&amp;ssl=1 1680w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Step 5: After creating an IAM user and attaching the appropriate group, you can share the access with the developer by providing them with the IAM user credentials and login URL.</p>



<p>To do this, you can follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Navigate to the IAM dashboard in your AWS console.</li>



<li>Select the IAM user you just created and click on the &#8220;Security credentials&#8221; tab.</li>



<li>Click on the &#8220;Create access key&#8221; button to generate an access key and secret access key for the user.</li>



<li>Share the access key and secret access key with the developer. You can do this by securely emailing them the credentials or sharing them through a secure file sharing service.</li>



<li>Also, share the URL for the AWS console login page with the developer, which is typically in the format &#8220;https://&lt;your-account-number&gt;.signin.aws.amazon.com/console&#8221;. The developer will need to enter the IAM user credentials to access the AWS console and start using the AWS services that they have been granted access to.</li>
</ol>



<p>It is important to emphasize the importance of keeping the IAM user credentials secure and confidential, as these credentials provide access to your AWS resources. Additionally, it is recommended to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to add an extra layer of security.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Step 6: AWS Access Key has many options. Pick CLI</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="970" height="1024" src="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?resize=970%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1268" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?resize=970%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?resize=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1 284w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?resize=768%2C811&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?resize=600%2C634&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11.png?w=1324&amp;ssl=1 1324w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chapter 2 :&nbsp; Unit Testing Frameworks</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A. Introduction to Unit Testing</strong></p>



<p>Unit testing is the practice of testing individual units of code to ensure that they work as intended. These units can be functions, methods, or classes. Unit testing is an essential part of software development, as it helps catch errors and bugs early in the development cycle, which reduces the cost of fixing them later.</p>



<p><strong>B. Comparison of Popular Unit Testing Frameworks</strong></p>



<p>There are several popular unit testing frameworks available for Node.js and React applications. Here are four of the most popular ones:</p>



<p>Jest: Jest is a popular unit testing framework developed by Facebook. It provides an easy-to-use interface for writing and executing tests. Jest includes built-in mocking and snapshot testing capabilities, making it an excellent choice for testing React components. Jest also includes a code coverage tool to help ensure that all code paths are covered by tests.</p>



<p>Mocha: Mocha is a flexible and extensible testing framework that can be used for both server-side and client-side testing. Mocha&#8217;s flexibility comes from the fact that it does not include its assertion library, allowing developers to use their preferred assertion library. Mocha also includes support for asynchronous testing and hooks, which can be used to set up and tear down test environments.</p>



<p>Ava: Ava is a lightweight and fast testing framework designed for running tests concurrently. Ava includes a built-in assertion library and supports asynchronous testing out of the box. Ava&#8217;s concurrency capabilities make it an excellent choice for large codebases with many tests.</p>



<p>Tape: Tape is a simple and minimalist testing framework that focuses on ease of use and minimal configuration. Tape does not include an assertion library or mocking capabilities, making it a good choice for developers who prefer to use separate libraries for these tasks. Tape&#8217;s simplicity makes it an excellent choice for small codebases or for getting started with unit testing.</p>



<p><strong>C. Pros and Cons of Each Framework</strong></p>



<p>Each unit testing framework has its strengths and weaknesses, and developers should consider these when choosing a framework. Here are some of the pros and cons of the four frameworks discussed above:</p>



<p>Jest: Pros &#8211; Easy to use, includes mocking and snapshot testing capabilities, good code coverage tool. Cons &#8211; Can be slow, may be too opinionated for some developers.</p>



<p>Mocha: Pros &#8211; Flexible and extensible, supports asynchronous testing and hooks. Cons &#8211; Requires additional libraries for assertion and mocking capabilities.</p>



<p>Ava: Pros &#8211; Lightweight and fast, supports concurrent testing. Cons &#8211; Limited mocking capabilities, may require additional configuration for complex test setups.</p>



<p>Tape: Pros &#8211; Simple and easy to use, minimal configuration required. Cons &#8211; Does not include an assertion library or mocking capabilities, may not be suitable for large codebases.</p>



<p><strong>D. Use Cases and Examples</strong></p>



<p>Each unit testing framework is suitable for different use cases and scenarios. For example, Jest is an excellent choice for testing React components, while Mocha may be a better choice for server-side testing. Here are some examples of how each framework can be used:</p>



<p>Jest: Jest is an excellent choice for testing React components, as it includes built-in mocking and snapshot testing capabilities.</p>



<p>Mocha: Mocha can be used for both server-side and client-side testing and is a good choice for developers who need flexibility and extensibility.</p>



<p>Ava: Ava&#8217;s concurrency capabilities make it an excellent choice for large codebases with many tests.</p>



<p>Tape: Tape&#8217;s simplicity makes it an excellent choice for getting started with unit testing or for small codebases.</p>



<p>Overall, choosing the right unit testing framework depends on the specific needs and requirements of your application. Developers should consider factors such as ease of use, flexibility, and testing capabilities when choosing a framework.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>| Jest | 
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

describe('sum function', () =&gt; {
  test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () =&gt; {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});
``` |
| Mocha | 
```javascript
const assert = require('assert');

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

describe('sum function', () =&gt; {
  it('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () =&gt; {
    assert.equal(sum(1, 2), 3);
  });
});
``` |
| Ava | 
```javascript
import test from 'ava';

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', t =&gt; {
  t.is(sum(1, 2), 3);
});
``` |
| Tape | 
```javascript
const test = require('tape');

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

test('sum function', t =&gt; {
  t.equal(sum(1, 2), 3);
  t.end();
});
``` |

Note: These code snippets are only intended as simple examples to illustrate how each framework works. The actual implementation of unit tests will vary depending on the specific needs of your application.

<p>Testing frameworks help to standardize the testing process, making it easier for teams to collaborate and ensure that all aspects of the application are tested thoroughly. They also provide a range of features, such as test runners, assertions, and mocking libraries, that simplify the testing process and reduce the amount of code needed to write tests.</p>



<p>Moreover, testing frameworks provide a consistent and repeatable testing process, which helps to reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies. They also provide a framework for maintaining and updating tests as the application evolves over time, ensuring that the tests remain accurate and up-to-date.</p>



<p>Overall, testing frameworks are essential tools for web application development that help ensure the quality, reliability, and maintainability of your application. By using a testing framework, you can automate and streamline the testing process, reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies, and provide a consistent and repeatable testing process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overview of the testing frameworks to be discussed in the eBook</strong></h3>



<p>In this eBook, we will be discussing some of the most popular testing frameworks for Node.js and React web applications. Here is a brief overview of each of the frameworks we will be comparing:</p>



<p><strong>Mocha</strong>: Mocha is a popular unit testing framework for Node.js that provides a range of features such as test runners, assertions, and mocking libraries. It also supports asynchronous testing and can be used with a variety of other testing libraries and frameworks.</p>



<p><strong>Jest</strong>: Jest is a testing framework developed by Facebook that is designed specifically for testing React applications. It provides a range of features such as snapshot testing, mocking, and parallel test execution.</p>

<p><strong>Puppeteer</strong>: Puppeteer is a Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It provides a range of features for automating and testing web applications, including testing performance, accessibility, and user interaction.</p>



<p>By comparing and contrasting these popular testing frameworks, we aim to provide you with the knowledge and insights needed to make an informed decision about which testing framework is right for your Node.js or React web application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Different types of testing frameworks</h3>



<p>Testing frameworks can be broadly categorized into three different types based on the type of testing they are designed for:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unit Testing Frameworks</strong>: Unit testing frameworks are designed to test individual units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation. These frameworks are typically used for testing the functionality and correctness of small, self-contained parts of an application. Examples of popular unit testing frameworks include Mocha, Jest, and Jasmine.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Integration Testing Frameworks</strong>: Integration testing frameworks are designed to test the interaction between different components or modules of an application. These frameworks are typically used for testing the behavior and functionality of larger parts of an application, such as a group of related functions or a set of modules. Examples of popular integration testing frameworks include Cypress and Puppeteer.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>End-to-End Testing Frameworks</strong>: End-to-End (E2E) testing frameworks are designed to test the entire application from start to finish, including all of its components and interactions with external systems. These frameworks are typically used for testing the functionality, usability, and performance of an application under real-world conditions. Examples of popular E2E testing frameworks include Cypress and Puppeteer.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Specialized Testing Frameworks</strong>: In addition to the broad categories of testing frameworks, there are also specialized testing frameworks that are designed for specific types of testing, such as security testing, performance testing, and accessibility testing. Some popular examples of specialized testing frameworks include OWASP ZAP for security testing, Apache JMeter for performance testing, and Axe for accessibility testing. These frameworks often include support for specialized tests and metrics, allowing developers to test specific aspects of the application in-depth.</li>
</ul>



<p>Choosing the right type of testing framework depends on the specific needs and requirements of your application. Unit testing frameworks are typically used for catching errors in individual components, while integration testing frameworks are used for testing interactions between components. E2E testing frameworks are used for testing the entire application, while specialised testing frameworks can be used in conjunction with these broader categories to test specific aspects of the application. All these frameworks, including specialised testing frameworks, often include support for mocking and stubbing, allowing developers to simulate and isolate dependencies and focus on the specific code under test. Performance testing frameworks can also be used to test the speed and scalability of an application under various loads and conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; is a popular American television series that premiered on AMC in February 2015.

<p>Overall, &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; has been widely praised for its writing, direction, and performances, and has become a fan favorite among viewers who appreciate its dark humor, compelling characters, and tense, dramatic storylines.</p>



<p>But what I find particularly insightful is the character of Jimmy/Saul, the acting, and learnings that sales and marketing people can take away. So here are some key insights from the serieis.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key Insights</h3>



<p>One key insight into the world of sales and marketing that can be gleaned from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Power of storytelling to build an emotional connection with your clients</h4>



<p>Throughout the show, Jimmy/Saul often tells compelling stories to persuade people to take his side. For example, in season 1, episode 8, Jimmy/Saul is trying to convince a potential client to hire him as their lawyer. He tells the story of a previous case he won, where he represented an elderly woman who had been scammed by a con artist. Jimmy/Saul describes how he was able to track down the con artist and get the woman her money back, painting himself as a hero and instilling confidence in the potential client that he can also solve their legal issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1234" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>This is a powerful tactic that sales and marketing people can use when talking to prospects. By telling stories that illustrate how their product or service has helped others in similar situations, they can build trust and credibility with the prospect, and increase the likelihood that the prospect will choose to do business with them.</p>



<p>Another key insight that can be gleaned from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; for sales and marketing professionals is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of understanding your audience.</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul often tailors his communication style and approach to the specific person he is trying to persuade. For example, in season 2, episode 6, Jimmy/Saul is trying to convince a group of elderly people to sign up for a retirement home&#8217;s class action lawsuit. He uses a folksy, down-to-earth approach, peppering his speech with references to old TV shows and songs that he knows will resonate with the older demographic.</p>



<p>This is a valuable lesson for sales and marketing people, who should take the time to research and understand their audience before trying to sell them anything. By tailoring your messaging and approach to your audience&#8217;s needs and interests, you can increase the chances of a successful sale or conversion. This can include using language that resonates with their particular industry or talking about specific pain points that you know they are struggling with. By showing that you understand their needs and can provide solutions that are relevant to them, you can build trust and establish a connection that is crucial for successful sales and marketing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="563" src="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png?resize=1000%2C563&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1235" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/plainswipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Another insight that sales and marketing professionals can learn from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221;: </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The power of word-of-mouth marketing.</h4>



<p>Throughout the show, Jimmy/Saul frequently relies on referrals and personal recommendations from satisfied clients to attract new business. For example, in season 1, episode 5, Jimmy/Saul represents a pair of skateboarders who were injured while filming a video. He wins their case and they become his advocates, spreading the word about his services to their friends and fellow skateboarders.</p>



<p>This is a powerful reminder that word-of-mouth marketing can be one of the most effective ways to attract new customers. By providing excellent service and going above and beyond for your existing clients, you can turn them into brand ambassadors who will recommend your product or service to others. This can include offering exceptional customer service, providing personalized recommendations or solutions, or simply going the extra mile to make sure your clients are satisfied. In today&#8217;s social media-driven world, positive reviews and recommendations from satisfied customers can be more valuable than any other form of advertising.</p>



<p>Another key insight from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; for sales and marketing professionals is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of persistence</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul often faces rejection and setbacks in his attempts to win new clients and cases. However, he never gives up and continues to pursue his goals with determination and creativity. For example, in season 1, episode 3, Jimmy/Saul is trying to convince a potential client to hire him as their lawyer, but the client is initially resistant. Rather than giving up, Jimmy/Saul comes up with a creative plan to win the client over, which involves staging a fake accident and convincing the client that he needs legal representation.</p>



<p>This is a valuable lesson for sales and marketing professionals, who may also face rejection or obstacles in their attempts to win new business. By staying persistent and looking for creative solutions to problems, you can increase your chances of success. This may involve following up with a prospect multiple times, trying different approaches, or finding a way to differentiate your product or service from competitors. While persistence may not always guarantee success, it can be a crucial factor in overcoming obstacles and achieving your goals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of building relationships with your clients.</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul frequently goes above and beyond to build personal connections with his clients, often taking the time to get to know them on a personal level and empathize with their struggles. For example, in season 1, episode 9, Jimmy/Saul represents a woman who is being scammed by a con artist. Rather than just focusing on the legal aspects of the case, Jimmy/Saul takes the time to comfort the woman and provide emotional support, even staying with her overnight to make sure she feels safe.</p>



<p>This is a valuable lesson for sales and marketing professionals, who should strive to build strong relationships with their clients and customers. By taking the time to get to know your clients on a personal level, you can better understand their needs and goals, and tailor your solutions accordingly. This can involve sending personalized messages or recommendations, checking in with clients regularly to see how they are doing, or simply showing genuine interest in their lives and experiences. By building trust and rapport with your clients, you can establish a long-term relationship that is beneficial for both parties.</p>



<p>Another key insight from &#8220;Better Call Saul&#8221; for sales and marketing professionals is the </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of being adaptable and flexible.</h4>



<p>In the show, Jimmy/Saul often has to pivot and change his approach on the fly to adapt to unexpected situations or new information. For example, in season 4, episode 4, Jimmy/Saul is representing a client who is facing criminal charges. However, he discovers that the client is actually guilty and has lied to him about the details of the case. Rather than giving up, Jimmy/Saul quickly shifts his strategy and comes up with a new plan to negotiate a plea deal for the client.</p>



<p>To do this, Jimmy/Saul used his knowledge of the legal system and his relationships with other lawyers and officials to navigate the negotiation process. He was able to convince the prosecutor that his client was remorseful and willing to cooperate, and to negotiate a deal that would result in a reduced sentence and a chance for his client to turn his life around.</p>



<p>This example highlights the importance of adaptability and flexibility in sales and marketing. Just as Jimmy/Saul was able to pivot his strategy and find a new approach to achieve his goals, sales and marketing professionals may also need to be willing to change course and try new tactics to overcome challenges and achieve success. By staying agile and responsive to new information and changing circumstances, you can increase your chances of achieving your objectives and achieving long-term success.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging social media or personal connections to gain access to key decision-makers at target companies</h4>



<p> In season 1, episode 1, Jimmy/Saul poses as a grieving family member to gain access to a potential client and win his business. He attends a funeral for the deceased, pretending to be an old friend from college. He approaches the grieving widow and strikes up a conversation, eventually revealing that he is a lawyer who can help her with her husband&#8217;s outstanding legal issues.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Creating engaging and informative video content to promote their SAAS solution</h4>



<p>In season 1, episode 4, Jimmy/Saul creates a fake commercial to advertise his legal services on local TV. He hires a film crew and actors to create a commercial that pokes fun at traditional law firm advertising and positions him as a more relatable and approachable lawyer.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Using humor and empathy to build rapport with prospects and overcome objections</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Research on the decision-makers at their target companies and finding ways to connect with them on a personal level</h4>



<p>In season 5, episode 5, Jimmy/Saul uses his charm and wit to win over a judge who is hesitant to grant his client&#8217;s request. He engages in small talk with the judge, using his knowledge of the judge&#8217;s personal interests and hobbies to build rapport. He then presents his case in a way that appeals to the judge&#8217;s sense of fairness and justice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Combining data and analytics with emotional storytelling to create a compelling case for their SAAS solution</h4>



<p>In season 5, episode 10, Jimmy/Saul uses a combination of logic and emotion to win over a potential client. He presents a logical argument for why his legal services are superior to those of his competitor, but he also appeals to the potential client&#8217;s emotional attachment to their current lawyer. He acknowledges the emotional difficulty of switching lawyers and presents himself as a trustworthy and empathetic alternative.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a sense of urgency and scarcity around their SAAS solution.</h4>



<p>In season 2, episode 1, Jimmy/Saul uses his knowledge of human psychology to influence the behavior of a group of potential clients. He creates a sense of scarcity and urgency by telling them that his services are in high demand and that he can only take on a limited number of clients. He also uses social proof by mentioning some high-profile clients that he has worked with in the past.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Demonstrating their expertise and experience in the field </h4>



<p>In season 5, episode 1, Jimmy/Saul uses his expertise and experience to win over a potential client who is skeptical about his abilities. He presents a detailed plan of action that addresses the client&#8217;s specific needs and concerns, and he demonstrates his knowledge of the industry by using technical jargon and other specialised language.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Importance of understanding the language and culture of your target audience, and using it to build rapport and establish trust. </h4>



<p>In season 1, episode 1, Jimmy/Saul demonstrates the power of a well-crafted elevator pitch when he convinces two skateboarders to become his first clients. He starts by quickly establishing his credentials as a lawyer, but then he connects with the skateboarders on a personal level by using slang and humor that they can relate to. This shows the importance of understanding the language and culture of your target audience, and using it to build rapport and establish trust.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>All these come with hefty price tags, where as mautic is free and open source, the only challenge is that it isn’t easy to use and most people don’t know how to configure it for lead management.</p>

<p>Mautic provides several features that enable businesses to assign leads to specific sales reps, track phone calls made by sales reps, and implement a schedule for following up with leads. Here&#8217;s a brief overview of how these features can be used:</p>



<ol>

</ol>



<p>To evenly distribute leads among your sales reps, you can use Mautic&#8217;s lead scoring and routing features. You can set up rules to automatically distribute leads among your sales reps based on their availability and workload. You can also use Mautic&#8217;s notification and reporting features to keep track of which leads have been assigned to which sales reps and monitor their progress through the sales funnel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up lead scoring in Mautic:</h3>



<ol>
<li>Create a lead scoring model: To set up lead scoring in Mautic, you first need to create a lead scoring model. To do this, go to &#8220;Settings&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Lead Scoring&#8221; and click the &#8220;New&#8221; button. Give your model a name and description, and click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</li>



<li>Create scoring rules: Once you have created a lead scoring model, you need to create scoring rules to assign points to leads based on their behavior and activity. To do this, click the &#8220;New Rule&#8221; button. Choose a trigger for the rule, such as &#8220;Website page visit,&#8221; &#8220;Form submission,&#8221; or &#8220;Email open.&#8221; Then, set the number of points you want to assign to leads who trigger this rule. Repeat this process to create scoring rules for other triggers.</li>



<li>Set up lead scoring actions: Once you have created your scoring rules, you can set up actions that will be triggered when a lead reaches a certain score threshold. To do this, go to &#8220;Actions&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Lead Scoring Actions&#8221; and click the &#8220;New&#8221; button. Choose the action you want to take when a lead reaches the score threshold, such as assigning the lead to a sales rep or sending a follow-up email.</li>



<li>Assign scores to fields: In addition to creating scoring rules, you can also assign scores to specific fields in a lead&#8217;s profile. To do this, go to &#8220;Fields&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Lead Fields&#8221; and click on the field you want to score. Under the &#8220;Scoring&#8221; tab, enter the number of points you want to assign to leads who have a value in this field.</li>



<li>Test your lead scoring model: Once you have set up your lead scoring model, you can test it by creating a new lead and triggering the scoring rules you have set up. You can view a lead&#8217;s score and see which rules they have triggered by going to &#8220;Leads&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Manage Leads&#8221; and selecting the lead you want to view.</li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s it! With these steps, you should be able to set up lead scoring in Mautic and start using it to prioritize your leads and automate your marketing and sales processes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to assign leads to specific sales reps in Mautic:</h3>



<ol>
<li>Create a custom field for sales rep: To assign leads to specific sales reps, you first need to create a custom field in Mautic to store the sales rep&#8217;s name or ID. To do this, go to &#8220;Fields&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Lead Fields&#8221; and click the &#8220;New&#8221; button. Give your field a name, such as &#8220;Sales Rep,&#8221; and choose the field type that corresponds to the type of data you want to store (text, dropdown, etc.). Click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</li>



<li>Create sales rep user accounts: Next, you need to create user accounts for your sales reps in Mautic. To do this, go to &#8220;Users&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Manage Users&#8221; and click the &#8220;New&#8221; button. Enter the sales rep&#8217;s name and email address, choose a username and password, and assign them to the appropriate user group. Click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</li>



<li>Set up lead routing rules: To automatically assign leads to specific sales reps, you need to create lead routing rules in Mautic. To do this, go to &#8220;Settings&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Lead Routing&#8221; and click the &#8220;New&#8221; button. Choose the criteria you want to use to assign leads to sales reps, such as lead source, lead score, or geography. Then, choose the sales rep you want to assign the lead to based on the value in the &#8220;Sales Rep&#8221; custom field you created in step 1.</li>



<li>Test your lead routing rules: Once you have set up your lead routing rules, you can test them by creating new leads in Mautic and verifying that they are assigned to the correct sales rep. You can view a lead&#8217;s assigned sales rep by going to &#8220;Leads&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Manage Leads&#8221; and selecting the lead you want to view.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to move a lead through different stages in Mautic:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create lead stages: To move a lead through different stages, you first need to create lead stages in Mautic. To do this, go to &#8220;Settings&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Lead Stages&#8221; and click the &#8220;New&#8221; button. Give your stage a name, such as &#8220;New Lead&#8221; or &#8220;Qualified Lead,&#8221; and a description if desired. Repeat this process to create all the stages you need for your lead management process.</li>



<li>Assign stages to leads: Once you have created your lead stages, you can assign them to individual leads in Mautic. To do this, go to &#8220;Leads&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Manage Leads&#8221; and select the lead you want to move to a new stage. Click the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button, then choose the appropriate stage from the &#8220;Stage&#8221; dropdown menu. Click &#8220;Save.&#8221;</li>



<li>Set up automation rules: To automate the process of moving leads through different stages, you can set up automation rules in Mautic. To do this, go to &#8220;Campaigns&#8221; &gt; &#8220;New Campaign&#8221; and choose &#8220;Lead Based&#8221; as the campaign type. Choose a trigger for the rule, such as &#8220;Lead moves to a new stage&#8221; or &#8220;Lead fills out a form.&#8221; Then, set up an action that moves the lead to the next stage in your lead management process.</li>



<li>Test your automation rules: Once you have set up your automation rules, you can test them by creating new leads in Mautic and verifying that they are moved through the appropriate stages based on their behavior and activity.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here is a list of stages that a B2B SaaS product might need for its lead management process:</h3>



<ol>
<li>Awareness: This is the first stage of the lead management process, where a lead becomes aware of your product or service. This stage might involve lead generation through channels like social media, content marketing, or advertising.</li>



<li>Interest: In the interest stage, a lead shows interest in your product or service by visiting your website, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a piece of content.</li>



<li>Evaluation: In the evaluation stage, a lead begins to evaluate your product or service and its fit for their business needs. This stage might involve product demos, sales calls, or consultations.</li>



<li>Purchase: In the purchase stage, a lead becomes a paying customer and completes the transaction to use your product or service.</li>



<li>Onboarding: In the onboarding stage, the customer is guided through the process of setting up and using your product or service, and getting value from it.</li>



<li>Adoption: In the adoption stage, the customer has successfully onboarded and is actively using your product or service in their day-to-day work.</li>



<li>Expansion: In the expansion stage, the customer begins to expand their use of your product or service, perhaps by upgrading to a higher tier or adding additional features.</li>



<li>Advocacy: In the advocacy stage, the customer becomes an advocate for your product or service, spreading the word to their network and helping to drive more leads and customers to your business.</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, the specific stages and terminology used will vary depending on the business and the product or service being offered. But this list should give you a good starting point for thinking about the lead management process for a B2B SaaS product.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how you can implement a series of reminders for leads in Mautic:</h3>



<ol>
<li>Set up lead imports: First, you will need to set up your lead import process so that new leads are automatically added to Mautic. This might involve integrating Mautic with your CRM or lead capture forms.</li>



<li>Create email campaigns: In Mautic, create a series of email campaigns that will be triggered based on the lead&#8217;s job title and industry. For example, you might create a campaign for leads in the healthcare industry, and another campaign for leads with the job title &#8220;Marketing Manager&#8221;.</li>



<li>Add email triggers: Within each email campaign, add triggers that will automatically send an email when a lead matches the criteria for that campaign. For example, you might set up a trigger to send an email to leads in the healthcare industry when they are first imported into Mautic.</li>



<li>Create reminders: In Mautic, create reminders that will prompt you or your sales team to take specific actions with each lead. For example, you might create a reminder to send a message to a lead on Instagram or Twitter after a few days, or to call the lead after a set number of days.</li>



<li>Assign reminders to team members: Assign each reminder to a specific team member so that they receive a notification when it is due. For example, you might assign the Instagram/Twitter message reminder to your social media manager, and the call reminder to your sales team.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As more and more businesses migrate to the cloud, optimizing cloud costs has become an essential part of managing their cloud infrastructure. In this article, we will discuss some cost-saving strategies for AWS that can help businesses reduce their cloud costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Use the cost explorer to discover the services that are taking most of your costs</h4>



<p>The cost explorer is a tool in AWS that allows users to analyze and visualize their AWS costs and usage. It can help businesses identify which services are consuming the most resources and costing the most money. By analyzing this data, businesses can make informed decisions about which services to optimize or even shut down to reduce their costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Shut down inactive EC2 instances</h4>



<p>EC2 instances are a significant cost in AWS, and businesses can save money by shutting down instances that are not being used. This can be achieved by setting up an email alert that informs the user if an instance is idle for greater than x% of the time. The user can then decide to shut down the instance manually or automate the process using AWS Lambda.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: If you are using ECS, Adjust ECS task definitions based on CPU and Memory utilization</h4>



<p>ECS is a container orchestration service in AWS that allows businesses to run and scale containerized applications. By analyzing the CPU and memory utilization of the tasks in the service, businesses can adjust the task definitions of the compute to have lesser CPUs or memory, reducing the cost of the service.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: Move from ELB to Application Load Balancer</h4>



<p>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a service in AWS that distributes incoming traffic to multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. However, the cost of ELB can be significant, and businesses can save money by moving to Application Load Balancer (ALB), which offers more advanced features at a lower cost.</p>



<p>Pros of using ALB include:</p>



<ul>
<li>More granular routing options</li>



<li>Better support for containerized applications</li>



<li>Native support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket protocols</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Consider using alternatives like NGINX for load balancing</h4>



<p>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and NGINX are both popular load balancing solutions, but they differ in their approach and capabilities. Here is a comparison table that highlights the differences between ELB and NGINX:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>ELB</th><th>NGINX</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cost</td><td>Can be expensive for larger deployments</td><td>Open-source, free, and paid options</td></tr><tr><td>Configuration</td><td>Limited configuration options</td><td>Flexible and customizable</td></tr><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>Can scale up and down automatically</td><td>Can scale up and down manually</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>Can handle high traffic volumes</td><td>Fast and efficient, high performance</td></tr><tr><td>SSL/TLS Offloading</td><td>Supports SSL/TLS offloading</td><td>Supports SSL/TLS offloading</td></tr><tr><td>Health Checks</td><td>Supports basic health checks</td><td>Supports advanced health checks</td></tr><tr><td>Protocols</td><td>Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP</td><td>Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP</td></tr><tr><td>Customization</td><td>Limited customization options</td><td>Highly customizable</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As you can see, both ELB and NGINX have their own strengths and weaknesses. ELB is a managed service, which means that AWS handles the infrastructure and management of the load balancer. However, this comes at a cost, and ELB can be expensive for larger deployments.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to setup NGINX for load balancing?</h4>



<p>To set up NGINX for load balancing and auto scaling with ECS, businesses can follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch an ECS cluster and service</li>



<li>Create a task definition with the NGINX container image</li>



<li>Configure NGINX to load balance requests to the ECS service</li>



<li>Set up auto scaling policies for the ECS service based on CPU or memory utilization</li>
</ul>



<ol start="7">
<li>Explore AWS Route 53 DNS-based load balancing</li>
</ol>



<p>AWS Route 53 is a DNS service that can be used to route traffic to multiple AWS resources, including EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. Businesses with a small number of instances can use Route 53’s DNS-based load balancing to route traffic to their instances, reducing the cost of ELB or ALB.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: Consider using Route 53 DNS based Load Balancing</h4>



<p>If you have a small number of instances, you can use AWS Route 53 DNS-based load balancing to route traffic to your instances. This can be a cost-effective option for smaller applications. A tutorial with sample code can help you set up this service and optimize your usage of it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">To set up Route 53 DNS-based load balancing, businesses can follow these steps:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Create a Route 53 hosted zone</li>



<li>Add DNS records for the resources to be load balanced</li>



<li>Create a health check for the resources</li>



<li>Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the healthy resources</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure NGINX for load balancing and auto scaling if you are using ECS:</h4>



<ol>
<li>Launch an Amazon ECS cluster:</li>
</ol>



<p>First, launch an Amazon ECS cluster using the ECS optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI). You can follow the instructions in the Amazon ECS documentation to create an ECS cluster.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Create an ECS service:</li>
</ol>



<p>Next, create an ECS service that will run your application. You can follow the instructions in the Amazon ECS documentation to create an ECS service.</p>



<ol start="3">
<li>Install NGINX:</li>
</ol>



<p>Once your ECS cluster and service are up and running, you can install NGINX on an EC2 instance that will act as the load balancer. You can follow the instructions in the NGINX documentation to install NGINX on an EC2 instance.</p>



<ol start="4">
<li>Configure NGINX:</li>
</ol>



<p>Next, you need to configure NGINX to act as the load balancer for your ECS service. You can do this by creating an NGINX configuration file that specifies the IP addresses and ports of your ECS tasks.</p>



<p>Example of SAMPLE NGINIX configuration file</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>http {
    upstream ecs_cluster {
        server &lt;ecs_task_ip_address_1&gt;:&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;;
        server &lt;ecs_task_ip_address_2&gt;:&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;;
        server &lt;ecs_task_ip_address_3&gt;:&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;;
    }
 
    server {
        listen 80;
 
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://ecs_cluster;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>



<p>In this configuration file, replace <code>&lt;ecs_task_ip_address&gt;</code> with the IP address of your ECS tasks, and <code>&lt;ecs_task_port&gt;</code> with the port number that your tasks are running on.</p>



<p></p>



<ol start="5">
<li>Configure auto scaling:</li>
</ol>



<p>Finally, you can configure auto scaling for your ECS service by creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that triggers when your ECS tasks exceed a certain CPU utilization threshold. When the alarm is triggered, it can automatically launch new ECS tasks to handle the increased load.</p>



<p>You can follow the instructions in the Amazon ECS documentation to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm and configure auto scaling for your ECS service.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it! With NGINX, you can configure load balancing and auto scaling for your ECS service to handle increased traffic and demand.</p>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A target tracking scaling policy for an ECS service</h4>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how you can create an Application Auto Scaling policy for scaling ECS tasks:</p>



<ol>
<li>Define a scalable target:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "ecs_target" {
  max_capacity       = 10
  min_capacity       = 1
  resource_id        = "service/${aws_ecs_service.my_service.name}"
  scalable_dimension = "ecs:service:DesiredCount"
  service_namespace  = "ecs"
}</code></pre>



<p>This block of code defines an Application Auto Scaling target for an ECS service. The <code>resource_id</code> attribute specifies the ECS service to scale, while the <code>max_capacity</code> and <code>min_capacity</code> attributes define the maximum and minimum number of tasks to run.</p>



<ol start="2">
<li>Define a scaling policy:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_appautoscaling_policy" "ecs_policy" {
  name               = "ecs-scaling-policy"
  policy_type        = "TargetTrackingScaling"
  resource_id        = "${aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.id}"
  scalable_dimension = "ecs:service:DesiredCount"

  target_tracking_scaling_policy_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization"
    }
    target_value = 60.0
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This block of code defines an Application Auto Scaling policy for an ECS service. The <code>policy_type</code> attribute specifies that this is a target tracking scaling policy, which adjusts the number of tasks to maintain a target value for a specified metric. In this case, we are using the <code>ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization</code> metric and setting a target value of 60%. This means that Application Auto Scaling will automatically adjust the number of tasks to maintain a CPU utilization of around 60%.</p>



<p>3. Attach the policy to the target:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_appautoscaling_policy_attachment" "ecs_attachment" {
  policy_arn = "${aws_appautoscaling_policy.ecs_policy.arn}"
  target_arn = "${aws_appautoscaling_target.ecs_target.arn}"
}</code></pre>



<p>This block of code attaches the Application Auto Scaling policy to the ECS service target.</p>



<p>With this setup, Application Auto Scaling will automatically adjust the number of ECS tasks running in response to changes in the specified metric (in this case, CPU utilization). This allows your application to automatically scale up and down to handle varying workloads without requiring manual intervention.</p>



<p>Note that you can customize the metrics and target values to suit your specific use case. You can also create multiple Application Auto Scaling policies for the same target, each with different metrics and target values.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Configure NGINX to act as a load balancer</h4>



<p>To configure NGINX to act as a load balancer, you can follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Install NGINX: You can install NGINX on your server by using your package manager. For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you can use the following command to install NGINX:</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
</code></pre>



<p>Configure NGINX as a load balancer: You can configure NGINX to act as a load balancer by editing the <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> file. Here is an example configuration for a simple load balancer that balances requests between two backend servers:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>http {
    upstream backend {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>



<p>In this configuration, the <code>upstream</code> directive defines a group of backend servers, and the <code>proxy_pass</code> directive in the <code>location</code> block directs requests to the backend servers.</p>



<p>Restart NGINX: After editing the configuration file, you need to restart NGINX to apply the changes. You can use the following command to restart NGINX:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo systemctl restart nginx</code></pre>



<p>Test the load balancer: To test the load balancer, you can use a tool like <code>curl</code> to send requests to the server. For example, you can use the following command to send a request to the load balancer:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>curl http://example.com</code></pre>



<p>You should see a response from one of the backend servers.</p>



<p>Configure ECS with task definitions and auto scaling</p>



<p>To configure ECS with task definitions and auto scaling, you can follow these general steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a task definition: A task definition is a blueprint for how to run a specific Docker container within a task. It specifies the Docker image to use, how much CPU and memory to allocate to the task, and other configuration details. You can create a task definition using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</li>



<li>Create a service: A service is a long-running task that is automatically started and stopped by ECS. A service is associated with a task definition, and it can be configured to run a specific number of tasks (called the desired count). You can create a service using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</li>



<li>Configure auto scaling: You can use the AWS Application Auto Scaling service to set up auto scaling for your ECS services. Auto scaling allows you to automatically increase or decrease the number of tasks in your service based on metrics like CPU usage or memory usage. To configure auto scaling, you&#8217;ll need to create an auto scaling target and a scaling policy. You can do this using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how to create an ECS service with task definitions and auto scaling using the AWS Management Console:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a task definition:
<ul>
<li>Go to the Amazon ECS console and choose &#8220;Task Definitions&#8221; from the left navigation pane.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create new Task Definition&#8221; and select &#8220;EC2&#8221; or &#8220;Fargate&#8221; depending on your requirements.</li>



<li>Configure the task definition details like the container image, CPU, memory, port mappings, etc.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create&#8221; to save the task definition.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Create a service:
<ul>
<li>From the ECS console, select &#8220;Clusters&#8221; from the left navigation pane and choose the cluster you want to use.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create Service&#8221; and configure the service details like the task definition, desired count, and load balancer settings.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create Service&#8221; to save the service.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Configure auto scaling:
<ul>
<li>From the Amazon ECS console, choose &#8220;Clusters&#8221; from the left navigation pane and select the cluster you want to use.</li>



<li>Choose the &#8220;Services&#8221; tab and select the service you want to set up auto scaling for.</li>



<li>Choose the &#8220;Auto Scaling&#8221; tab and select &#8220;Configure Auto Scaling.&#8221;</li>



<li>Choose the metrics to use for scaling, such as CPU utilization or memory usage.</li>



<li>Configure the scaling policy, such as the minimum and maximum number of tasks to run.</li>



<li>Choose &#8220;Create&#8221; to save the auto scaling configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>With these steps completed, ECS will automatically start and stop tasks as needed based on the scaling policies you&#8217;ve configured.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Here is an example Terraform code for configuring an ECS service to use the target group:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">resource "aws_ecs_service" "example" {
  name            = "example-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.example.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.example.arn
  desired_count   = 2
  
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.example.arn
    container_name   = "example-container"
    container_port   = 80
  }
}
</pre>



<p>here is an example of how to create an <code>aws_lb_target_group</code> resource in Terraform:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>resource "aws_lb_target_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-target-group"
  port        = 80
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.example.id

  health_check {
    path     = "/"
    protocol = "HTTP"
  }
}</code></pre>



<p>This creates an <code>aws_lb_target_group</code> resource named &#8220;example-target-group&#8221; listening on port 80 using the HTTP protocol, and performing a health check by sending an HTTP request to the root path of the target. The target group is associated with the VPC identified by the <code>aws_vpc.example.id</code> variable.</p>
